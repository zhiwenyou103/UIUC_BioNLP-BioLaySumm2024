    "test_train = ['The strengths of our study are its innovative methods of characterizing seasonality of mortality dynamically over space and time , by age group and cause of death; using wavelet and centre of gravity analyses; using ERA-Interim data output to compare the association between seasonality of death rates and regional temperature . A limitation of our study is that we did not investigate seasonality of mortality by socioeconomic characteristics which may help with understanding its determinants and planning responses . \\n We used wavelet and centre of gravity analyses , which allowed systematically identifying and characterizing seasonality of total and cause-specific mortality in the USA , and examining how seasonality has changed over time . We identified distinct seasonal patterns in relation to age and sex , including higher all-cause summer mortality in young men ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018 )',\n",
    " 'Importantly , we also showed that all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality is largely similar in terms of both timing and magnitude across diverse climatic regions with substantially different summer and winter temperatures . Insights of this kind would not have been possible analysing data averaged over time or nationally , or fixed to pre-specified frequencies . Prior studies have noted seasonality of mortality for all-cause mortality and for specific causes of death in the USA ( Feinstein , 2002; Kalkstein , 2013; Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) . Few of these studies have done consistent national and subnational analyses , and none has done so over time , for a comprehensive set of age groups and causes of death , and in relation to regional temperature differences',\n",
    " 'Our results on strong seasonality of cardiorespiratory diseases deaths and weak seasonality of cancer deaths , restricted to older ages , are broadly consistent with these studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) , which had limited analysis on how seasonality changes over time and geography ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) . Similarly , our results on seasonality of injury deaths are supported by a few prior studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) , but our subnational analysis over three decades revealed variations in when injury deaths peaked and in how seasonal differences in these deaths have changed over time in relation to age group which had not been reported before . A study of 36 cities in the USA , aggregated across age groups and over time , also found that excess mortality was not associated with seasonal temperature range ( Kinney et al . , 2015 )',\n",
    " 'In contrast , a European study found that the difference between winter and summer mortality was lower in colder Nordic countries than in warmer southern European nations ( Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) ( the study’s measure of temperature was mean annual temperature which differed from the temperature difference between maximum and minimum mortality used in our analysis although the two measures are correlated ) . The absence of variation in the magnitude of mortality seasonality indicates that different regions in the USA are similarly adapted to temperature seasonality , whereas Nordic countries may have better environmental ( e . g . housing insulation and heating ) and health system measures to counter the effects of cold winters than those in southern Europe',\n",
    " 'If the observed absence of association between the magnitude of mortality seasonality and seasonal temperature difference across the climate regions also persists over time , the changes in temperature as a result of global climate change are unlikely to affect the winter-summer mortality difference . The cause-specific analysis showed that the substantial decline in seasonal mortality differences in adolescents and young adults was related to the diminishing seasonality of ( unintentional ) injuries , especially from road traffic crashes , which are more likely to occur in the summer months ( Liu et al . , 2005 ) and are more common in men',\n",
    " 'The weakening of seasonality in boys under five years of age was related to two phenomena: first , the seasonality of death from cardiorespiratory diseases declined , and second , the proportion of deaths from perinatal conditions , which exhibit limited seasonality ( Figure 9—figure supplement 2 and Figure 10—figure supplement 3 ) , increased ( MacDorman and Gregory , 2015 ) . In contrast to young and middle ages , mortality in older ages , where death rates are highest , maintained persistent seasonality over a period of three decades ( we note that although the percent seasonal difference in mortality has remained largely unchanged in these ages , the absolute difference in death rates between the peak and minimum months has declined because total mortality has a declining long-term trend ) . This finding demonstrates the need for environmental and health service interventions targeted towards this group irrespective of geography and local climate',\n",
    " 'Examples of such interventions include enhancing the availability of both environmental and medical protective factors , such as better insulation of homes , winter heating provision and flu vaccinations , for the vulnerable older population ( Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Social interventions , including regular visits to the isolated elderly during peak mortality periods to ensure that they are optimally prepared for adverse conditions , and responsive and high-quality emergency care , are also important to protect this vulnerable group ( Healy , 2003; Lerchl , 1998; Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Emergent new technologies , such as always-connected hands-free communications devices with the outside world , in-house cameras , and personal sensors also provide an opportunity to enhance care for the older , more vulnerable groups in the population , especially in winter when the elderly have fewer social interactions ( Morris , 2013 )',\n",
    " 'Such interventions are important today , and will remain so as the population ages and climate change increases the within- and between-season weather variability . \\n We used data on all 85 , 854 , 176 deaths in the USA from 1980 to 2016 from the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) . Age , sex , state of residence , month of death , and underlying cause of death were available for each record . The underlying cause of death was coded according to the international classification of diseases ( ICD ) system ( 9th revision of ICD from 1980 to 1998 and 10th revision of ICD thereafter ) . Yearly population counts were available from NCHS for 1990 to 2016 and from the US Census Bureau prior to 1990 ( Ingram et al . , 2003 ) . We calculated monthly population counts through linear interpolation , assigning each yearly count to July',\n",
    " 'We also subdivided the national data geographically into nine climate regions used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Figure 18 and Table 2 ) ( Karl and Koss , 1984 ) . On average , the Southeast and South are the hottest climate regions with average annual temperatures of 18 . 4°C and 18°C respectively; the South also possesses the highest average maximum monthly temperature ( 27 . 9°C in July ) . The lowest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the Southeast ( an average range of 17 . 5°C ) . The three coldest climate regions are West North Central , East North Central and the Northwest ( 7 . 6°C , 8 . 0°C , 8 . 2°C respectively ) . Mirroring the characteristics of the hottest climate regions , the largest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the coldest region , West North Central ( an average range of 30 . 5°C ) , which also has the lowest average minimum monthly temperature ( −6 . 5°C in January )',\n",
    " 'The other climate regions , Northeast , Southwest , and Central , possess similar average temperatures ( 10°C to 14°C ) and variation within the year of ( 23°C to 26°C ) , with the Northeast being the most populous region in the United States ( with 19 . 8% total population in 2016 ) . Data were divided by sex and age in the following 10 age groups: 0–4 , 5–14 , 15-24 , 25–34 , 35–44 , 45–54 , 55–64 , 65–74 , 75–84 , 85+\\xa0years . We calculated monthly death rates for each age and sex group , both nationally and for sub-national climate regions . Death rate calculations accounted for varying length of months , by multiplying each month’s death count by a factor that would make it equivalent to a 31 day month . For analysis of seasonality by cause of death , we mapped each ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to four main disease categories ( Table 1 ) and to a number of subcategories which are presented in the Supplementary Note . Cardiorespiratory diseases and cancers accounted for 56 . 4% and 21',\n",
    " '2% of all deaths in the USA , respectively , in 1980 , and 40 . 3% and 22 . 4% , respectively , in 2016 . Deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases have been associated with cold and warm temperatures ( Basu , 2009; Basu and Samet , 2002; Bennett et al . , 2014; Braga et al . , 2002; Gasparrini et al . , 2015 ) . Injuries , which accounted for 8% of all deaths in the USA in 1980 and 7 . 3% in 2016 , may have seasonality that is distinct from so-called natural causes . We did not further divide other causes because the number of deaths could become too small to allow stable estimates when divided by age group , sex and climate region . We obtained data on temperature from ERA-Interim , which combines predictions from a physical model with ground-based and satellite measurements ( Dee et al . , 2011 ) . We used gridded four-times-daily estimates at a resolution of 80 km to generate monthly population-weighted temperature by climate region throughout the analysis period',\n",
    " 'We used wavelet analysis to investigate seasonality for each age-sex group . Wavelet analysis uncovers the presence , and frequency , of repeated maxima and minima in each age-sex-specific death rate time series ( Hubbard , 1998; Torrence and Compo , 1998 ) . In brief , a Morlet wavelet , described in detail elsewhere ( Cazelles et al . , 2008 ) , is equivalent to using a moving window on the death rate time series and analysing periodicity in each window using a short-form Fourier transform , hence generating a dynamic spectral analysis , which allows measuring dynamic seasonal patterns , in which the periodicity of death rates may disappear , emerge , or change over time',\n",
    " 'In addition to coefficients that measure the frequency of periodicity , wavelet analysis estimates the probability of whether the data are different from the null situation of random fluctuations that can be represented with white ( an independent random process ) or red ( autoregressive of order one process ) noise . For each age-sex group , we calculated the p-values of the presence of 12 month seasonality for the comparison of wavelet power spectra of the entire study period ( 1980–2016 ) with 100 simulations against a white noise spectrum , which represents random fluctuations . We used the R package WaveletComp ( version 1 . 0 ) for the wavelet analysis . Before analysis , we de-trended death rates using a polynomial regression , and rescaled each death rate time series so as to range between 1 and −1 . To identify the months of maximum and minimum death rates , we calculated the centre of gravity and the negative centre of gravity of monthly death rates',\n",
    " 'Centre of gravity was calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , with each month weighted by its death rate; negative centre of gravity was also calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , but with each month was weighted by the difference between its death rate and the year’s maximum death rate . In taking the weighted average , we allowed December ( month 12 ) to neighbour January ( month 1 ) , representing each month by an angle subtended from 12 equally-spaced points around a unit circle . Using a technique called circular statistics , a mean ( θ- ) of the angles ( θ1 , θ2 , θ3… , θn , ) representing the deaths ( with n the total number of deaths in an age-sex group for a particular cause of death ) is found using the relation below:θ-=arg∑j=1nexp\\u2061 ( iθj ) , where arg denotes the complex number argument and θj denotes the month of death in angular form for a particular death j',\n",
    " 'The outcome of this calculation is then converted back into a month value ( Fisher , 1995 ) . Along with each circular mean , a 95% confidence interval ( CI ) was calculated by using 1000 bootstrap samples . The R package CircStats ( version 0 . 2 . 4 ) was used for this analysis . For each age-sex group and cause of death , and for each year , we calculated the percent difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months . We fitted a linear regression to the time series of seasonal differences from 1980 to 2016 , and used the fitted trend line to estimate how much the percentage difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months had changed from 1980 to 2016 . We weighted seasonal difference by the inverse of the square of its standard error , which was calculated using a Poisson model to take population size of each age-sex group through time into account',\n",
    " 'This method gives us a p-value for the change in seasonal difference per year , which we used to calculate the seasonal difference at the start ( 1980 ) and end ( 2016 ) of the period of study . Our method of analysing seasonal differences avoids assuming that any specific month or group of months represent highest and lowest number of deaths for a particular cause of death , which is the approach taken by the traditional measure of Excess Winter Deaths . It also allows the maximum and minimum mortality months to vary by age group , sex and cause of death .']"

Variations in the single-channel properties of the opsins can be exploited to generate rapid action potential trains or sustained depolarizations ( Mattis et al', ', 2012 ) , and new red-shifted variants have facilitated excitation deeper in tissue and have enabled simultaneous optical control of two distinct neuronal populations ( Klapoetke et al . , 2014; Lin et al . , 2013; Yizhar et al . , 2011 )', 'In addition , genetic restriction of opsin expression using transgenic mouse lines enhances the ability to activate and assess the connectivity of specific cell types . Despite the great potential of optogenetics for mapping the synaptic connections of single neurons , there are multiple issues that have limited its effectiveness', 'First , two-photon activation of single neurons with ChR2 is complicated by its kinetics and low single-channel conductance . A diffraction-limited spot does not activate sufficient channels simultaneously to reliably bring neurons expressing ChR2 to action potential threshold . Several solutions have been implemented to address this', 'Rapid scanning of a diffraction-limited two-photon excitation spot across an opsin-expressing cell allows sufficient temporal integration to generate action potentials ( Packer et al . , 2012; Prakash et al . , 2012; Rickgauer and Tank , 2009 ) . Alternatively , scanless two-photon excitation by temporal focusing ( Oron et al . , 2005; Zhu et al', ', 2005 ) increases the number of simultaneously excited opsin molecules by expanding the beam in the imaging plane without sacrificing the optical sectioning of multiphoton microscopy ( Andrasfalvy et al . , 2010; Losonczy et al . , 2010; Papagiakoumou et al . , 2010; Rickgauer et al . , 2014 ) . The implementation of diffractive optical elements ( Fino and Yuste , 2011; Nikolenko et al', ', 2007; Packer and Yuste , 2011 ) or spatial light modulators ( Dal Maschio et al . , 2010; Nikolenko et al . , 2008; Packer et al . , 2012 , 2015; Papagiakoumou et al . , 2010 , 2009 , 2008 ) has also allowed for more complicated excitation profiles that encompass multiple spots around a cell , ensembles of neurons , or particular branches of dendritic trees', 'While these approaches have made it possible to provide sufficient two-photon illumination to reliably drive action potentials , the ability to use optogenetic stimulation to selectively target single neurons remains challenging because the opsins are expressed throughout the dendritic and axon terminal fields , generating a potential confounding source of light-induced electrical responses', \"For example , it can be difficult to know whether a recorded electrophysiological event is due to stimulation of a presynaptic cell or 'direct' stimulation of a portion of the recorded cell’s dendritic arbor . Although these possibilities can be distinguished by their kinetics , large amplitude direct responses may obscure simultaneous smaller synaptic events\", \"This essentially leaves an indeterminate region of any circuit 'map' coinciding with the dendritic arbors of the recorded neuron , which can extend for 200 µm or more around the soma\", 'In addition , the optogenetic approach could be compromised by unintended activation of fibers of passage or local axonal boutons , which are known to respond to temporal focusing of two-photon excitation ( Andrasfalvy et al . , 2010; Losonczy et al . , 2010 )', 'Exclusion of opsins from axonal compartments has previously been achieved by fusing the opsin with targeting domains that bind to myosin Va motors necessary for transporting proteins into dendrites; one such motif from melanophilin is sufficient to exclude ChR2 from axons and enhance the resolution of neural circuit maps ( Lewis et al . , 2009 )', 'The resulting ChR2 distribution , however , remains throughout the dendritic tree and thus does not solve the problem of undesired direct activation of a neuron’s processes while trying to stimulate other neurons in close proximity . To overcome these limitations , we combined temporal focusing with spatial confinement of ChR2 expression to the neuronal cell body and proximal dendrites', 'Our alternative targeting approach took advantage of the Kv2 . 1 potassium channel , which has a particularly unique localization to clusters at the neuronal soma and proximal dendrites ( Trimmer , 1991 ) achieved through a 66-amino acid domain in its C-terminus ( Lim et al', ', 2000 ) that drives its association with myosin IIb and specific post-Golgi transport vesicles destined for the somatic compartment ( Jensen et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , this targeting signal is sufficient to alter ChR2 trafficking in retinal ganglion cells ( Wu et al . , 2013 )', 'We have employed this approach to target ChR2 to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons in somatosensory cortex and added a nuclear fluorescent tag to identify ChR2-expressing neurons for targeting a two-photon temporal focused mapping beam', 'We combined this soma-targeted ChR2 with verification of successful action potential generation with a genetically encoded calcium indicator in our mapping protocol', 'Our approach allows robust and precise activation of neurons in brain slices for the construction of functional synaptic connectivity maps with single-cell resolution without loss of information about local connections in the region of the dendritic arbor of the recorded neuron or inadvertent activation of axons', 'We stimulated neurons expressing soma-targeted ChR2 in acute slices of mouse cortex using scanless temporal focusing ( TF ) , which has been used successfully for optogenetic stimulation at high axial resolution in scattering tissue samples ( Andrasfalvy et al . , 2010; Losonczy et al . , 2010; Papagiakoumou et al . , 2010 , 2013; Rickgauer et al . , 2014 )', 'TF uses a diffraction grating ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) to separate the spectral components of a pulsed laser beam , resulting in a temporally broadened pulse that is inefficient at excitation except at the focal plane , where the components are recombined', 'This yields a volume of excitation in which the diameter in the x-y plane and the thickness in the axial plane are controlled independently ( Oron et al . , 2012 , 2005 ) . We designed our excitation volume to approach the dimensions of a typical neuronal soma ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 )', 'To restrict expression of ChR2 to the soma and proximal dendrites , we generated ChR2 fusion proteins by attaching a 65 amino acid motif from the Kv2 . 1 voltage-gated potassium channel to the carboxy terminus of ChR2-EYFP ( Lim et al . , 2000 )', 'Nontargeted ChR2-EYFP fluorescence was distributed throughout the processes of dissociated cortical neurons that had been filled with a fluorescent dye ( Figure 1A ) .

In contrast , cells expressing the targeted construct exhibited significant currents only when stimulated within the 25–50 µm immediately adjacent to the cell body', 'The lack of direct light-activated currents throughout much of the neuron’s dendritic field makes it possible to visualize synaptic currents that would be evoked by ChR2 activation of nearby presynaptic neurons , even those that lie within the neuron’s dendritic field', 'In brain sections from mice injected with viruses encoding ChR2 constructs , examination of regions near the edge of the extent of virus-driven expression revealed markedly denser labeling of neuronal processes around a single-neuron expressing nontargeted ChR2 versus the area around several neurons expressing the targeted version ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A )', 'We also saw processes reminiscent of axons at distances of several hundred microns away from the cell bodies of conventional ChR2-positive neurons', 'To functionally characterize the extent of axonal opsin expression , we again patched layer II/III pyramidal neurons in acute coronal brain slices of somatosensory cortex and recorded light-activated currents in voltage clamp while stimulating multiple positions along putative axonal processes , which were distinguished by their thin profile , absence of spines , and presence of occasional varicosities', 'Although the amount of detected current decreased rapidly for both constructs as TF stimulation was moved along the axon , noticeable currents could be detected at distances of 50 µm or greater from the soma of cells expressing nontargeted ChR2 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3B )', 'In contrast , cells expressing targeted ChR2 demonstrated an 80% reduction of current when stimulating just 20 µm down the axon and significantly less current than cells expressing nontargeted ChR2 throughout its examined length ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3C )', 'Interestingly , the targeted ChR2 also exhibited increased peak current amplitude in response to TF activation , presumably by concentrating channel density at the soma ( Figure 2A; from 308 . 3 ± 43 . 5\\u2009pA in 12 nontargeted cells to 760 . 5\\xa0±\\xa0146 . 0\\u2009pA in 12 targeted cells at 3 . 63 mW/µm2; p=0', '0101 for main effect of targeting by two-way repeated measures ANOVA ) , leading to an over three-fold reduction of the power required to reach action potential threshold ( Figure 2B; from 2 . 75\\xa0±\\xa00 . 31 mW/µm2 in 17 nontargeted cells to 0 . 88\\xa0±\\xa00 . 23 mW/µm2 in 19 targeted cells; p=8 . 028\\xa0×\\xa010–5 by Mann-Whitney U Test )', 'At the threshold stimulation power for each cell , the amount of evoked current was similar between targeted and untargeted constructs ( 261 . 06\\xa0±\\xa031 . 62\\u2009pA for untargeted ChR2 and 222 . 70\\xa0±\\xa027 . 21\\u2009pA for targeted ChR2 p=0', '3677 by two sample t-test ) , consistent with the observation that the targeting modification had no effect on rheobase , other intrinsic physiological parameters , or action potential properties in response to current injections ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Table 1 )', 'The ability to trigger action potentials at lower incident power , coupled with the somatic restriction of the targeted construct , should provide enhanced spatial and temporal resolution for mapping neuronal circuits', 'We measured the spatial resolution of action potential generation by moving the TF spot to different lateral and axial locations relative to a patched neuron expressing targeted ChR2 and examining the proportion of 10 trials that resulted in an action potential when using the threshold stimulation intensity .

Consistent with this interpretation , these off-target calcium events were observed at a significantly lower frequency in experiments with the targeted opsin ( 5 . 42\\xa0±\\xa01 . 39% , p<0 . 01 by two sample t-test )', 'Moreover , the average distance between a cell exhibiting an off-target calcium transient and the intended target cell was greater with nontargeted ChR2 ( 40 . 6\\xa0±\\xa06 . 4 µm versus 18 . 9\\xa0±\\xa02 . 4 µm; p<0 . 01 by two sample t-test ) , further suggesting that cells expressing nontargeted ChR2 were firing action potentials in response to unintended stimulation of distal dendrites', 'Our combination of TF and restricted ChR2 thus facilitated the mapping of local circuitry within the 300 µm surrounding a neuron without confounding signals from its dendritic arbor and with a higher throughput than that achieved with electrophysiological techniques alone . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14193 . 014Figure 4 .

ChR2 harboring the Kv2 . 1 localization motif also showed enhanced sensitivity , which is of particular use in situations where excitation power is at a premium', 'Together these features of the soma-restricted construct significantly enhance the ability to map synaptic connections with single-cell resolution . The development of spatially-restricted optogenetic constructs is probably one of the most effective means for achieving single-cell resolution in local circuit mapping experiments', 'This restriction requires the identification of a relatively small compartment near the neuronal soma characterized by selective expression of particular proteins with known motifs responsible for their localization', 'The distribution of particular voltage-gated potassium channels defines such a subcellular domain along the soma and proximal dendrites ( Trimmer , 2015 ) , and the sufficiency of a short Kv2 . 1 C-terminal sequence for driving heterologous proteins to this region ( Lim et al . , 2000 ) made this strategy ideal for restricting ChR2 expression', 'The only obvious alternative is restriction to the axon initial segment ( AIS ) mediated by an ankyrin G binding motif present in voltage-gated sodium channels ( Garrido et al . , 2003 ) . Although incorporating this motif into ChR2 drives its localization to the AIS ( Grubb and Burrone , 2010; Wu et al', ', 2013 ) , the resulting construct does not support light-generated action potentials under physiological conditions ( Grubb and Burrone , 2010 ) . Moreover , AIS-targeted ChR2 alters the intrinsic firing properties of retinal neurons , presumably by displacing endogenous voltage-gated sodium channels whose subcellular localization is also dependent on ankyrin G binding ( Zhang et al . , 2015 )', 'Therefore , the Kv2 . 1 targeting strategy currently remains the optimal means of concentrating ChR2 such that action potentials will not be generated by TF stimulation of dendrites >20 µm away from the soma . Indeed , this approach has been successfully used with opsins to artificially generate center-surround receptive fields in retinal ganglion cells ( Wu et al . , 2013 ) . The Wu et al', '( 2013 ) study showed functional restriction of opsins to the soma and proximal dendrites by examining receptive field responses to wide ( 200\\xa0µm ) bars of one-photon light', 'We have now measured the somatic targeting at a finer scale , demonstrated two-photon excitation of targeted ChR2 that is enhanced relative to normal ChR2 under the same conditions , and established the utility of targeted opsins for enhancing the resolution of local connectivity maps of neural circuits', 'The soma-targeted ChR2 could be combined with many of the techniques for two-photon optical control of neuronal activity previously developed for caged neurotransmitters or optogenetic probes . The relative merit of the optical activation method depends on the axial resolution , temporal precision required and the number of neurons to be stimulated simultaneously in a given experimental paradigm', 'For example , rapid scanning of a diffraction-limited two-photon excitation spot in a pattern on the soma can generate action potentials ( Packer et al . , 2012; Prakash et al . , 2012; Rickgauer and Tank , 2009 ) and combination with spatial light modulators allows for simultaneous excitation of neuronal ensembles ( Packer et al . , 2012 , 2015 )', 'The temporal resolution of this rapid scanning approach , however , is limited by the time required to scan along the cell body . Scanless activation of untargeted ChR in brain slices using TF , alone or in combination with spatial light modulators , is capable of generating action potentials in hippocampal pyramidal neurons within 1–3 ms of light onset ( Andrasfalvy et al', ', 2010 ) and in cortical neurons in less than 10 ms ( Papagiakoumou et al . , 2010 ) . We did not take full advantage of the temporal precision capability of TF to fire action potentials in our current study , instead focusing on a screening method that would identify connections without optimizing the amount of power that would fire each potential presynaptic neuron with minimal latency', 'We therefore chose longer pulses at a power sufficient to fire most neurons and generate trains of action potentials , which would elicit stronger signals with calcium indicators . For experiments requiring temporal precision , the minimization of action potential latency requires optimization of excitation area and laser power ( Papagiakoumou et al . , 2008 )', 'Because power is also the limiting factor in extending the area of two-photon activation to large numbers of neurons with spatial light modulators , the reduced power required to bring soma-targeted opsins to threshold would be an asset to such experiments', 'The optimal performance of our method relies on sufficient co-expression of an opsin , a marker for opsin expression , and a genetically encoded calcium sensor . For GCaMP6s and similar sensors , there appears to be a balance between sufficient expression to detect single action potentials and excessive levels that lead to a lack of responsiveness ( Chen et al . , 2013; Packer et al', ', 2015; Tian et al . , 2009 ) . Targeting this expression window can be complicated , particularly when simultaneously trying to achieve high opsin levels using a separate AAV construct', 'Indeed , heterogeneity in GCaMP expression levels between neurons with viral infection may be partially responsible for the 20% of neurons in which we did not detect a change in GCaMP fluorescence with TF stimulation', 'We have also explored the co-expression of GCaMP6s as the second member of a single P2A-mediated bicistronic construct , but the GCaMP6s expression level was lower than desired , resulting in inadequate detection of action potentials ( data not shown )', 'Future development of these techniques will therefore benefit from bypassing viral systems and instead expressing the calcium sensor or the opsin in transgenic animals . The enhanced sensitivity of the targeted ChR2 should alleviate the concern that there would be sufficient opsin expression from a single genetic locus for activation of neurons with two-photon excitation', 'There are several opportunities for future extension of this method . The somatic targeting approach could also be exploited in the context of other opsins such as C1V1 , which has recently been leveraged for two-photon stimulation of neural circuits in acute slices and in vivo ( Packer et al . , 2012 , 2015; Prakash et al . , 2012; Rickgauer et al . , 2014 )', 'Other molecules which may\\xa0be good candidates for somatic targeting include the red-shifted ReaChR for its sensitivity ( Lin et al . , 2013 ) and Chronos for its rapid temporal characteristics ( Klapoetke et al . , 2014 )', 'Moreover , the somatic restriction of membrane-bound genetically encoded voltage sensors could dramatically reduce background associated with the neuropil and facilitate an all-optical version of our current method . Because the Kv2', '1 targeting sequence is unable to restrict the distribution of the single-pass membrane protein CD8 , however , there may be certain structural constraints on the effectiveness of the motif ( Lim et al . , 2000 ) . We suspect that at least for the opsins , which are all seven transmembrane domain proteins likely to have a similar structure , the Kv2', '1 motif will be sufficient to achieve somatic localization . In summary , our combination of TF and soma-restricted ChR2 enables functional connectivity mapping and is straightforward and easy to implement with standard two-photon microscopes', 'Furthermore , these techniques could also be used in vivo , where the enhanced resolution of the targeted ChR2 makes it especially attractive for selective cell stimulation in behavioral paradigms', 'These enhancements to probing brain microcircuitry through optical stimulation promise to reveal much about nervous system function and how it might be modified by experience and perturbed in animal models of neurologic or psychiatric disease . \\n The vector pAAV-hSyn-hChR2 ( H134R ) -EYFP ( Addgene plasmid 26973 ) served as the backbone for generating certain modified constructs', \"The 'proximal restriction and clustering signal' ( Lim et al . , 2000 ) of the Kv2\", '1 voltage-gated potassium channel ( QSQPILNTKEMAPQSKPPEELEMSSMPSPVAPLPARTEGVIDMRSMSSIDSFISCATDFPEATRF ) , codon optimized for mouse , was generated by automated gene synthesis ( Integrated DNA Technologies , Coralville , IA ) and amplified by PCR using primers CGGCATGGACGAGCTGTACAAGCAGTCCCAGCCTATTCTGAAC and TGATATCGAATTCTTACTTAAACCGCGTAGCCTCTGG', 'The resulting product was inserted into the BsrGI site at the C-terminus of the ChR2-EYFP fusion protein sequence using the Gibson Assembly kit ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) .

      "\t ['The granular retrosplenial cortex ( RSG ) is critical for both spatial and non-spatial behaviors , but the underlying neural codes remain poorly understood .

Observed thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable computational models of LR neurons to compute the speed of head rotation , despite receiving head direction inputs that do not explicitly encode speed', 'Thus , parallel input streams identify a distinct principal neuronal subtype ideally positioned to support spatial orientation computations in the RSG . \\n Activity in the granular retrosplenial cortex ( RSG ) is correlated with a wide variety of behaviors , including spatial navigation , learning , memory , fear conditioning , imagination , and planning for the future ( Alexander et al', ', 2020; Alexander and Nitz , 2017; Chang et al . , 2020; Chrastil , 2018; Hinman et al . , 2018; Mao et al . , 2018; Miller et al . , 2021; Miller et al . , 2019 ) . The RSG is also among the most densely connected regions of the brain , integrating inputs from a bevy of cortical and subcortical sources and serving as part of the default mode network ( Greicius et al . , 2009; Kaboodvand et al', ', 2018; Liu et al . , 2019; Whitesell et al . , 2021 ) . While these anatomical connections are well-documented ( Van Groen and Wyss , 2003; van Groen and Wyss , 1990; Whitesell et al . , 2021; Wyss and Van Groen , 1992 ) , few studies have examined their functional nature ( Nitzan et al . , 2020; Yamawaki et al . , 2019b; Yamawaki et al . , 2019a; Yamawaki et al', ', 2016a ) , and cell-type specificity has yet to be sufficiently explored . Such knowledge is critical to develop a mechanistic understanding of how the RSG integrates information from multiple sources to carry out its spatial and non-spatial functions', 'Cortical regions , including the RSG , receive inputs from one or more thalamic nuclei ( Herkenham , 1986; Herkenham , 1980; Jones , 2001; Jones , 1998; Peters , 1979; Van Groen and Wyss , 1995 ) .

We show that the synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs allow for the robust encoding of angular speed by LR cell models , even though these inputs only explicitly contain information about head direction , not speed', 'Together , our results suggest that LR neurons are ideally positioned to contribute to the initial spatial orientation computations performed in superficial RSG . \\n Layer 3 of the granular retrosplenial cortex ( RSG ) contains two types of principal pyramidal neurons: the low-rheobase ( LR ) neuron and the regular-spiking ( RS ) neuron ( Brennan et al . , 2020; Kurotani et al', ', 2013; Yousuf et al . , 2020 ) . Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings , we again distinguished LR from RS neurons by their unique intrinsic properties , predominantly the low rheobase , high input resistance , lack of adaptation , and narrow spike width ( Figure 1A–C , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 , Supplementary file 1\\xa0-\\xa0Table\\xa01 , and Supplementary file 1\\xa0-\\xa0Table\\xa02; Brennan et al . , 2020 )', 'We used channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping ( CRACM ) to interrogate inputs to these two cell types . Consistent with previous studies ( Odagiri et al . , 2011; Van Groen and Wyss , 2003; van Groen and Wyss , 1990; Yamawaki et al', ', 2019b ) , virus injections into the anterodorsal and anteroventral thalamic nuclei ( ADAV ) resulted in ChR2-eYFP expression in thalamocortical ( TC ) axons and terminals predominantly in layer 1a ( L1a; the most superficial part of layer 1 ) and in layer 3 ( L3 ) of superficial RSG ( Figure 1D )', 'To test whether these thalamocortical inputs target the LR and RS neurons in layer 3 , we stimulated the thalamic axons and terminals with 1 ms LED pulses at a 10 Hz frequency for 1 s at high LED power over the cell body of the patched neurons ( Figure 1E; see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods )', 'From resting membrane potentials of approximately −65 mV , LR neurons were strongly driven past spike threshold by these thalamic inputs while RS neurons exhibited far smaller EPSPs ( Figure 1F ) . To quantify the impact of TC inputs on LR and RS spike rates , we next depolarized the cells until they were spiking at 10–25 Hz and delivered a single LED pulse ( see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods )', 'To rule out effects of feed-forward inhibition in these experiments , the GABAA antagonist , picrotoxin ( 50 µM ) , was added to the bath . Compared to their baseline activity , this stimulation evoked a significant increase in spiking in LR neurons ( p=0 . 002 , Wilcoxon rank sum test ) but not RS neurons ( p=0 . 19 , Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figure 1G )', 'The LR neurons thus had a significantly larger increase in spike rate evoked by the optical pulse than RS neurons ( p=0 . 0012 , Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figure 1H ) . This suggests that LR neurons receive stronger activation from TC inputs than their neighboring L3 RS neurons . LR neurons are morphologically distinct from their neighboring RS neurons ( Brennan et al . , 2020; Kurotani et al', ', 2013; Yousuf et al . , 2020 ) . Given the precise laminar pattern of anterior thalamic inputs to RSG ( Figure 1D and Figure 2B ) , we next investigated the overlap between anterior thalamic afferents and the dendritic morphologies of reconstructed LR ( n\\xa0=\\xa010 ) and RS ( n\\xa0=\\xa05 ) cells ( see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods )', 'Apical dendrites of LR neurons were most densely localized to L1a , with basal dendrites remaining confined to L3 ( Figure 2C ) .

In the initial simulations shown in Figure 8 , the morphologically realistic model LR cell ( Brennan et al', ', 2020 ) received uniform inputs ( all HDs being equally likely ) via depressing synapses with Tsodyks-Markram short-term dynamics ( Tsodyks et al . , 1998 ) . The synaptic parameters were fit to match the experimentally observed response of LR cells to optogenetic stimulation of thalamic afferents reported above ( Figure 7 )', 'We found that the firing rate of the postsynaptic LR cell receiving HD input via depressing synapses was strongly correlated with angular head speed , giving rise to symmetrical angular head velocity tuning ( Figure 8B&C ) . Identical HD inputs transmitted via non-depressing synapses resulted in LR firing rates that were uncorrelated with angular head speed ( Figure 8B , E–F )', 'It is important to note that in our model , firing rates of input HD cells were not explicitly modulated by angular head velocity; therefore , the observed speed tuning resulted strictly from the depressing synaptic dynamics', 'For the parameter set whose results are depicted , LR cell firing rate was optimally correlated with head speed 24 ms in the past , confirmed by both cross-correlation and mutual information analyses ( Figure 8E&F )', 'We obtained the same results when modeling an ensemble of only 2500 presynaptic HD cells , indicating that our results are robust to the size of the presynaptic population ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 )', 'Taken together , these results suggest that synaptic depression of HD ensemble inputs introduces an angular head speed signal into the LR population , producing neurons that are more responsive during faster head turns , and potentially supporting the spatial orientation encoding functions attributed to the RSG ( Epstein , 2008; Ino et al . , 2007; Milczarek et al . , 2018; Miller et al . , 2019 )', 'Anterior thalamic HD cells display anticipatory firing ( Blair et al . , 1997 ) , a phenomenon where an HD cell becomes most active at a fixed time interval before the animal is facing that cell’s preferred direction ( Figure 9A ) .

In our initial simulations , shown in Figure 8 , we drew the ATI of each HD cell randomly from distributions matching these known in vivo ranges', 'To more systematically understand if and how the ATI of HD cells influences angular head speed coding by LR neurons , we next performed a series of simulations using various fixed ATI values for the entire HD population ( Figure 9A ) and analyzed the resulting postsynaptic LR response', 'Increasing ATI from 0 ms ( no anticipation by the HD cell ) to higher values ( HD cell firing prior to facing the preferred HD ) improved the lag between LR firing rate and angular head speed , with larger ATIs resulting in shorter latency between the head movement and LR coding of that angular head speed ( Figure 9C )', 'Remarkably , larger ATIs also improved the angular head speed tuning of LR neurons independent of lag , as quantified by the maximum value ( over the full range of lags ) of cross-correlation or cross-mutual information ( Figure 9B )', 'Thus , anticipatory firing of HD cells may constitute a powerful coding principle in the thalamo-retrosplenial circuit , helping LR cells to not only encode the current head speed with minimal lag , but also better encode the head speed independent of the lag', 'In order to better understand this surprising effect , as well as how speed tuning generally arises , we analytically studied a simplified mean-field model of this thalamo-retrosplenial circuit ( Figure 9—figure supplement 1 ) . Our analysis allowed us to mathematically derive that LR activity should encode head speed with depressing synapses from simplified HD cells ( see Appendix )', 'Moreover , the analysis showed that anticipatory firing compensates for the lag introduced by integration time , leading to a theoretical parameter regime for which postsynaptic speed coding can be essentially perfect ( where LR firing rate reflects head speed exactly with minimal latency )', 'The observed improvement in quality of speed coding with increases in ATI corresponds to moving closer to this regime . Finally , our analysis showed that postsynaptic activity , at least at lower rotational speeds , is proportional to the square of head speed , thereby explaining the concave-up , parabolic shape of the speed-firing rate curve ( Figure 8C and Figure 8—figure supplement 2 )', 'Thus , both the simulations and the analytical theory show that synaptic depression of HD cell input onto LR cells should result in angular speed coding in the LR cell firing rate , and that anticipatory firing improves both the precision and quality of this coding', 'In the simulations above , we utilized a uniform distribution of HD inputs to each LR cell , such that each preferred direction was equally represented . However , in practice , it is likely that there will be heterogeneity in the preferred HDs of the cells providing inputs to any given retrosplenial LR cell', 'To study the extent to which speed coding persists under these conditions , we simulated a population of 200 LR cells , each of which received inputs from a randomly selected distribution of preferred directions for the presynaptic HD cells ( Figure 10Ai , , Bi , Ci )', 'We then analyzed the information content of each LR cell’s firing rate , assessing the correlation and mutual information with both head direction and speed . We found that single cell activity in the LR population could encode both head direction and head speed ( Figure 10Aii , Bii , Cii ) , but there was a clear tradeoff between the two types of information', 'This tradeoff between directional versus speed encoding was explained by the level of heterogeneity in the presynaptic preferred direction distribution ( Figure 10D–F ) , making intuitive sense . If an LR cell receives inputs that represent each HD equally , then it is not biased towards any one HD and encodes direction poorly', 'However , it encodes head speed very strongly in this case because it is able to sample the speed across all directions—there are no directional blind spots where the LR cell cannot detect the speed of head rotation from its presynaptic inputs . On the other hand , consider an LR cell that , by chance , gets inputs from a higher proportion of HD cells encoding a direction around 180 degrees', 'Now , the output of this LR cell is better correlated with direction , acting as a broadly tuned HD cell itself and preferring 180 degrees , but also firing at most other directions . However , this LR cell’s encoding of head speed gets worse because it under-samples many of the head directions faced by an animal', 'Thus , non-uniform HD inputs via depressing thalamocortical synapses represent a simple mechanism by which LR cells can conjunctively encode both head direction and head speed', 'Overall , our results predict in vivo LR neuronal spike trains that are likely to correlate with both the head direction and rotational speed of an animal , with a tradeoff between direction versus speed coding seen across individual LR cells ( Figure 10E )', 'The small , excitable LR cells are unique among pyramidal cells in RSG , and there is no evidence , to our knowledge , for such cells in any other cortical regions ( Brennan et al . , 2020; Holmgren et al . , 2003; Jiang et al . , 2015; Kurotani et al . , 2013; Wyss et al . , 1990 )', 'Indeed , the ‘granular’ in granular retrosplenial cortex refers to the appearance of these dense small cell bodies in superficial RSG ( Sripanidkulchai and Wyss , 1987; Vogt and Peters , 1981 ) . Thus , LR cells are the defining morphological feature of RSG', 'The distinct electrophysiological properties of LR neurons , specifically , play an integral role in the RSG’s unique capacity to process anterior thalamic head direction inputs . We have previously reported that the low rheobase and lack of spike frequency adaptation of these neurons are their defining computational features ( Brennan et al . , 2020 )', 'For this reason , we refer to them as low-rheobase ( LR ) neurons . They have also been called late-spiking ( LS ) neurons ( Kurotani et al . , 2013; Yousuf et al . , 2020 ) , but we argue this name is not optimal for several reasons . First , many other neurons in superficial RSG are also late spiking ( Brennan et al', ', 2020 ) , with L2/3 fast-spiking ( FS ) interneurons and also some RS neurons exhibiting a substantial delay to first spike , likely due to increased Kv1 . 1 or 1 . 2 channel expression in this region compared to other cortical areas ( Kurotani et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , late-spiking is neither a distinctive feature of LR neurons nor excitatory neurons in this region', 'Second , the name ‘late-spiking ( LS ) neuron’ is already the accepted and widely used nomenclature referring to a distinct inhibitory neuronal subtype , the neurogliaform cells that are located throughout the cortical layers in many regions of the brain , including within layer 1 of RSG ( Cruikshank et al', ', 2012; Hestrin and Armstrong , 1996; Kawaguchi and Kubota , 1997; Overstreet-Wadiche and McBain , 2015 ) . Instead , the defining computational feature of the small pyramidal cells in L2/3 of the RSG is their low rheobase , and this nomenclature serves to provide an unambiguous name for these hyperexcitable cells ( Brennan et al . , 2020 )', 'Previous work has reported TC-evoked responses in layer 5 RS neurons at their apical dendrites ( Yamawaki et al . , 2019b ) , with some variation in the magnitude of responses across cells . Our results reproduce these observations ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . Layer 5 is not a homogenous layer , often divided into sublayers 5A and 5B ( Sempere-Ferràndez et al', ', 2019; Sempere-Ferràndez et al . , 2018; Sigwald et al . , 2020; Sripanidkulchai and Wyss , 1987; Yamawaki et al . , 2016a ) and contains a variety of pyramidal cells , including the thin-tufted and thick-tufted neurons who have been shown to exhibit different responses to external inputs ( Sempere-Ferràndez et al . , 2018; Wyss et al . , 1990 )', 'Further work is needed to determine whether any particular subtype of layer five pyramidal neurons may exhibit substantial TC-evoked responses , but our results , reporting significantly larger responses to TC input by LR neurons , suggest LR cells are the predominant spatial information-encoding subtype within RSG', 'The dorsal subiculum , which serves to transmit allocentric spatial information such as axis and boundary vector signals ( Lever et al . , 2009; Derdikman , 2009; Olson et al . , 2017; Simonnet and Brecht , 2019; Bicanski and Burgess , 2020 ) , also precisely targets LR neurons via projections predominantly to layer 3 of RSG ( Figure 5; Nitzan et al . , 2020; Yamawaki et al . , 2019a )', 'These inputs overlap with LR cell bodies , basal dendrites , and apical dendrites in L1b/c and evoke larger excitatory postsynaptic currents in superficial cells compared to layer 5 pyramidal neurons ( Figure 5; Nitzan et al . , 2020; Yamawaki et al . , 2019a )', 'Thus , the distinct morphology and intrinsic properties of LR neurons make them ideally suited to integrate head direction input from the thalamus and spatial inputs from the hippocampal formation via the dorsal subiculum', 'Indeed , this integration of various types of directional and distance information is often stated as the key computational function of the retrosplenial cortex as a whole ( van Wijngaarden et al . , 2020; Burgess et al . , 2001; Byrne et al . , 2007; Epstein , 2008; Ichinohe et al . , 2003; Maguire , 2001 ) , further highlighting the defining role that LR cells are likely to serve in the RSG', 'We have shown that thalamocortical synapses onto LR cells are depressing ( Figure 7 ) . Our modeling results demonstrate that such depressing synapses allow LR neurons to compute angular head speed from head direction input , leading to robust encoding of angular speed in the postsynaptic LR firing rate ( Figure 8 ) . This result is in line with previous studies ( Abbott et al', ', 1997; de la Rocha and Parga , 2008; Puccini et al . , 2007 ) that use synaptic depression to implement neural circuits that perform rate of change computations . We also find that LR encoding of angular head speed is improved by the fact that input HD cells display anticipatory firing ( Figure 9; Blair et al . , 1997 )', 'This improvement not only allows LR cells to encode current head speed with a shorter time lag ( Figure 9C ) , but also strengthens the correlation with head speed regardless of lag ( Figure 9B )', 'This proposed mechanism by which depressing synapses compute head speed is fully generalizable , and thus may also be of relevance to other brain circuits employing HD-like population codes ( Maunsell and Van Essen , 1983 )', 'Furthermore , we have shown that this thalamocortical synapse can support conjunctive encoding of both head direction and angular head speed by individual LR cells ( Figure 10 ) . Our results make specific predictions about the coding properties of LR cells that can be tested with in vivo recordings . First , based on their intrinsic properties ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1; Brennan et al', ', 2020 ) , LR cells in superficial RSG are likely to show high firing rates and spike widths intermediate to the standard ‘broad/narrow’ criteria currently used to distinguish putative RS and FS cells in most cortical recordings', 'Thus , future recordings will need a large sampling of cells in L2/3 of RSG to provide enough data to identify the predicted three distinct clusters of spike shapes ( RS/LR/FS ) . Second , we expect LR cell activity to be correlated with angular head speed with a relatively small lag ( Figures 8 and 9 )', 'Third , we predict that the experimentally observed head velocity tuning curves will be concave up and exhibit approximately quadratic scaling at low rotational speeds , as our analytical work suggests ( Figure 8; Appendix ) . Fourth , we anticipate a significant proportion of LR cells will show conjunctive encoding , where both angular head speed and direction are encoded', 'A key aspect of this conjunctive encoding , as predicted by our simulations ( Figure 10 ) , is that individual cells will show a tradeoff between directional and speed encoding', 'As a population , this is likely to allow LR cells to comprehensively encode conjunctive speed and directional information and provide this information to downstream targets , helping with spatial orientation computations within RSG . This predicted conjunctive encoding will also necessitate that the test of predictions 2 and 3 be carried out in a head-direction delimited manner', 'Our modeling work so far has focused on understanding the computational implications of thalamic inputs to LR cells . Future work , beyond the scope of the present study , will be needed to understand how these thalamic inputs interact precisely with dorsal subiculum inputs . Given the diversity of spatial and directional encoding seen in the dorsal subiculum ( Lever et al', ', 2009; Derdikman , 2009; Olson et al . , 2017; Simonnet and Brecht , 2019; Bicanski and Burgess , 2020 ) , computational models will allow for the rigorous undertanding of how each possible type of subicular input ( e . g . axis versus boundary vector cells ) to LR cells interacts with thalamic head direction inputs', 'Very recent work on understanding the tuning properties of subicular cells in a projection-specific manner will help to narrow the functional range of possible dorsal subicular inputs to LR cells ( Kitanishi et al . , 2021 ) . We anticipate that one key impact of dorsal subicular inputs to LR cells will be to impose a spatial filter on the angular speed and directional predictions stated above', 'In particular , the precise organization of layer 1 dendrites and axons may make LR cells most responsive to the near-synchronous arrival of inputs from both thalamic head direction cells ( at distal apical dendrites in L1a ) and dorsal subicular boundary vector or axis cells ( at more proximal apical dendrite locations in lower L1 )', 'Similar cooperative dendritic activation patterns are also a hallmark of integration of entorhinal and CA3 inputs by CA1 pyramidal cells , where they help to overcome the effects of strong dendritic inhibition and shape the firing of place cells ( Ahmed and Mehta , 2009; Golding and Spruston , 1998; Kamondi et al . , 1998; Takahashi et al . , 2012 )', 'LR neurons do not synapse onto neighboring excitatory neurons within layers 2/3 ( Brennan et al . , 2020 ) , and no ( 0/9 ) pairs tested in this study between LR and layer 5 RS cells exhibited connectivity ( data not shown ) . Thus , LR cells likely do not provide any substantial input to other LR cells or any RS cells located in layers 2–5 of ipsilateral RSG', 'Instead , LR neurons send their axons into the corpus callosum and may likely target homotopic regions of contralateral RSG ( Brennan et al . , 2020; Kurotani et al . , 2013 )', 'Indeed , retrograde injections into one RSG hemisphere have been shown to predominantly label small contralateral L2/3 cells ( Sripanidkulchai and Wyss , 1987; Van Groen and Wyss , 2003 ) , most likely corresponding to the LR cells that constitute the majority of cells in L2/3 ( Brennan et al . , 2020 )', 'Our supplementary results ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) show that inputs from contralateral RSG preferentially and strongly target RS neurons , with almost no recruitment of LR neurons . This is consistent with the observed distribution of afferent axons from contralateral RSG: these axons and terminals avoid L1a and L3 where all LR dendrites are located ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 )', 'Thus , we propose the following hypotheses for LR downstream targets and possible function: LR neurons in one hemisphere receive unilateral inputs from directional cells in the anterior thalamus ( Figures 1 , 2 and 6 )', 'These inputs are utilized to encode information about both the speed and direction of head rotations and are subsequently transmitted to RS cells in contralateral , but not ipsilateral , RSG ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . Thus , LR cells may serve to perform a hemispheric switch of rotational speed and direction information', 'Given the known bidirectional connectivity between secondary motor cortex and RSG ( Yamawaki et al . , 2016a ) , RS cells may be able to utilize inputs from contralateral LR cells to perform comparisons of the actual head speed and direction signal with motor efference signals , helping to sharpen the code for spatial orientation in the RSG', 'However , extensive future investigations of this contralateral circuit are needed to explore these hypotheses . In contrast to thalamic and DS inputs to RSG , projections from both the claustrum and anterior cingulate cortex avoid laminar overlap with LR apical dendrites , instead projecting to the lower divisions of L1/2 and L5 to target RS apical and basal dendrites ( Figures 3 and 4 , and 6 )', 'Both the CLA and ACC are heavily implicated in a range of non-spatial behaviors often described as being ‘cognitive’ or ‘mnemonic’ in function ( Botvinick , 2007; Brown and Braver , 2005; Carter et al . , 1998; Devinsky et al . , 1995; Kim et al . , 2016; Mohanty et al . , 2007; Smith et al . , 2012; Smythies et al . , 2012; Stevens et al', \", 2011 ) , but there is also evidence that these regions exhibit some degree of spatial information processing ( Guterstam et al . , 2015; Jankowski and O'Mara , 2015; Sutherland et al . , 1988; Whishaw et al . , 2001 )\", \"Indeed , 7–15% of cells in the claustrum were found to encode place or boundary-related information ( Jankowski and O'Mara , 2015 ) , though this percentage is relatively low compared to the 60% of anterior thalamic ( Taube , 1998 ) and 61% of dorsal subicular ( Kitanishi et al . , 2021 ) neurons that are known to clearly encode elemental direction , place , and other spatial features\", 'Regardless , retrosplenial RS neurons may be receiving direct spatial inputs from the CLA and ACC in addition to the cognitive and mnemonic information relayed by these two regions', 'We also speculate that retrosplenial RS neurons may receive directional and spatial information that has already been heavily integrated by LR neurons in the contralateral hemisphere ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) , as discussed above', 'This convergence of disparate signals onto RS cells could then serve to support functions that require both spatial and non-spatial integration , such as contextual fear conditioning , a key function attributed to the RSC ( de Sousa et al . , 2019; Keene and Bucci , 2008a; Keene and Bucci , 2008b; Kwapis et al . , 2015; Yamawaki et al . , 2019a )', 'Indeed , a recent study reported that selective ablation of putative retrosplenial RS cells located near the boundary and within upper layer 5 resulted in contextual fear amnesia ( Sigwald et al . , 2020 ) , indicating that these cells are involved in the fear-related functions of the retrosplenial cortex ( Lukoyanov and Lukoyanova , 2006; Yamawaki et al . , 2019a; Yamawaki et al . , 2019b )', 'The laminar location of these cells corresponds well to the position of the RS cells recorded in our study that we show to preferentially receive CLA and ACC inputs .

Future work that selectively inactivates CLA versus ACC axon terminals in RSC will be necessary to causally confirm the role of each of these synapses in fear conditioning', 'Another important consideration within the circuits examined here is the role of feedforward inhibition .

LR neurons receive directional and spatial inputs from the anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum . The synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs to LR cells can give rise to rate coding of angular head speed in LR cells', 'In contrast , neighboring RS neurons in RSG respond very weakly to these directional inputs , as their apical and basal dendrites distinctly avoid laminar overlap with anterior thalamic and subicular afferents . Instead , RS neurons respond to claustrocortical and anterior cingulate inputs', 'Determining how these two parallel streams of information are integrated in downstream neurons within both the ipsilateral and contralateral granular and dysgranular retrosplenial cortices is the next critical step toward a mechanistic understanding of retrosplenial computations', 'All procedures and use of animals were approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee', 'The following mouse lines were used for the CRACM experiments: Ai14 ( Jackson Laboratories , 007914 ) , Ai32 ( Jackson Laboratories , 024109 ) , C57BL6 wildtypes ( Charles River , stock #027 ) , Camk2αCre ( Jackson Laboratories , 005359 ) , Grp-KH288Cre ( RRID:MMRRC 037585-UCD ) , PvalbCre ( PV-IRES-Cre; Jackson Laboratories , 008069 ) , and PvalbCre x Ai14 ( crossed in house )', 'A combined total of 70 mice of both sexes between the ages of P41–P184 were used in this study .

Our recordings were obtained with a small field of view , at a high frame rate and centered on the soma ( ~19 . 3×19 . 3 µm , ~158 Hz , Figure 5A , B )', 'In an attempt to simulate commonly used imaging conditions , we downsampled our images in space and time to mimic imaging with a 412 × 412 µm field of view at 30 . 3 Hz , as used in the Allen Brain Observatory ( Figure 5C , D )', 'The baseline fluorescence noise from downsampled images was comparable to that in the Allen Brain Observatory ( Figure 5E ) and is presumably comparable to images in many two-photon datasets with populations of hundreds of neurons . As expected , event detection probabilities were lower for downsampled images than for the original , high-resolution images ( Figure 4D–F )', '1\\xa0AP and 2\\xa0AP event detection probabilities were 0 . 32\\xa0±\\xa00 . 05 and 0 . 55\\xa0±\\xa00 . 08 for 18 Emx1-s neurons , 0 . 43\\xa0±\\xa00 . 07 and 0 . 89\\xa0±\\xa00 . 06 for three tetO-s neurons , 0 . 16\\xa0±\\xa00 . 04 and 0 . 24\\xa0±\\xa00 . 04 for 9 Cux2-f neurons , 0 . 21\\xa0±\\xa00 . 04 and 0 . 42\\xa0±\\xa00 . 09 for 11 Emx1-f neurons ( mean ± SEM at 1% false positive probability ) . Even for 2\\xa0AP events , detection probability is\\xa0<0', '5 when imaging with GCaMP6f and a field of view of several hundred micrometers . In summary , 1\\xa0AP and 2\\xa0AP events were detected with high probability when images were acquired with high spatial and temporal resolution and when analysis was performed with an event detection algorithm optimized for each neuron using known AP times', 'Even with known AP times to optimize detection for each neuron , event detection was severely impaired by a reduction in spatial and temporal resolution to mimic a typical two-photon population imaging experiment . In a typical two-photon population imaging experiment , no electrophysiology recording is available to optimize event detection', 'Often , the shape of the calcium transient is estimated from published indicator rise and decay times or derived from a representative sample of fluorescence transients', 'What are typical event detection and false positive probabilities under these sub-optimal conditions\\xa0when the underlying AP times\\xa0are\\xa0unknown ? Is performance degraded equally for high and for low resolution images ? We compared event detection from high-resolution and downsampled images using three spike inference algorithms: unconstrained non-negative deconvolution ( NND; Friedrich et al', ', 2017 ) , non-negative deconvolution with an L0 constraint to enforce event sparseness ( Exact L0; Jewell et al . , 2020 ) , and a biophysical model that explicitly accounts for intracellular calcium dynamics ( MLspike; Deneux et al . , 2016 ) . These three algorithms are among the highest performing spike inference algorithms ( Berens et al . , 2018 )', 'For each neuron , the algorithms were deployed to estimate the number of APs in each image of the movie . All three algorithms estimated AP numbers that approximately recapitulated the number of APs measured with electrophysiology , but the number of APs per frame was typically not an integer due to imperfect spike inference ( Figure 6A , D )', 'We characterized performance using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Matthews correlation coefficient , which compare measured and estimated AP number at each time point and the presence or absence of an event at each time point , respectively . Pearson correlation coefficients were\\xa0~0 . 4 when calculated with 33 ms time bins , increasing toward 0', '7 as bin size was increased to 500 ms ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) , comparable to published results ( Berens et al . , 2018 ) . Mean Pearson and Matthews correlation coefficients were similar across inference algorithms and mouse lines and differed little between high-resolution and downsampled images ( Figure 6B , E )', 'We plot ROC curves to more directly examine the relationship between detected events and false positives . Since spike inference is generally useful only where false positive rates are low , we focused on false positive probabilities in the range of 0–0 . 05', 'Performance differed greatly between neurons , but mean ROC curves were similar across mouse lines , with only modest differences between algorithms , between GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f lines , or between high-resolution and downsampled conditions ( Figure 6C , F ) . Naturally , detection probability increased with the number of APs per event . At a false positive probability of 0', '01 , detection probability was commonly\\xa0<0 . 1 for 1\\xa0AP events , increasing approximately linearly with AP number , often to\\xa0~0 . 8 for 5\\xa0AP events ( Figure 7A , B ) . With 1\\xa0AP events being the most common event type in all four mouse lines ( Figure 7C ) , it was possible to detect only a minority of events with a low false positive probability', 'Using these spike inference algorithms , although detection probabilities were commonly slightly lower for downsampled than for high-resolution images , the difference was modest , indicating that the decreased SNR of population imaging had little effect on event detection in our dataset', 'Using our dataset , we compared event detection with three algorithms: unpenalized\\xa0NND , NND with L0 constraint and mathematically guaranteed globally optimal solution ( Exact L0 ) , and the biophysically inspired MLspike model . For NND , performance was poor at 30 Hz and considerably improved by upsampling to 150 Hz ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 )', 'Upsampling of low frame rate data , often to 100 Hz , is a common practice in the field ( Theis et al . , 2016; Berens et al . , 2018; Pachitariu et al . , 2018 ) . For MLspike , performance was poor without use of the autocalibration procedure to optimize the model for each neuron ( Figure 7—figure supplement 2 )', 'MLspike thus contrasted with deconvolution-based algorithms , for which fixed parameters are more effective ( Pachitariu et al . , 2018 ) . For Exact L0 , neither upsampling nor optimization for each neuron was necessary for optimal mean performance across neurons . Pachitariu et al', ', 2018 found that unpenalized\\xa0NND matched and often exceeded the performance of algorithms with sparsifying constraints such as NND with an approximate L0 constraint ( no mathematical guarantee of globally optimal solution ) . Consistent with the conclusions of\\xa0Pachitariu et al', ', 2018 , Exact L0 lagged the performance of NND for some metrics and genotypes ( Figure 7 A , B ) but was indistinguishable or even superior for others ( Figure 6B , E ) . The performance of MLspike was broadly equivalent to that of NND , but the loss of performance due to downsampling was less with MLspike , resulting in outperformance of MLspike on downsampled images', 'Our results point to MLspike as a compelling choice for spike inference in population imaging experiments . Our results also suggest that\\xa0there\\xa0is ample room for improvement of spike inference models since event detection by the three spike inference models falls far short of the performance of the ground truth-optimized approach employed in Figure 4 ( Figure 7—figure supplement 3 )', 'In summary , relative to small field-of-view imaging , population imaging conditions decreased the probability of spike event detection with an event detector optimized to each individual neuron using ground truth AP information ( Figure 4 )', 'With blind spike inference , many events went undetected even under near-ideal imaging conditions with a small field of view , and event detection was not substantially worse under population imaging conditions ( Figure 6 , Figure 7 , Figure 7—figure supplement 3 )', 'The results of Figures 6 and 7 are likely representative of event detection in many GCaMP6 imaging experiments , where ground truth AP information is not available and blind spike inference is employed', 'Our results indicate that even though GCaMP6 indicators are bright and sensitive enough to enable the detection of most 1\\xa0AP events in superficial cortical pyramidal neurons in vivo if the detection procedure is optimized using ground truth AP information , most events containing 1 , 2 , and sometimes greater numbers of APs go undetected in our ( and likely in\\xa0many other ) imaging experiments with GCaMP6', 'Calcium imaging is widely used to report neuronal spiking activity in vivo . However , accurate spike inference from calcium imaging remains a challenge , and there are relatively few ground truth datasets with simultaneous calcium imaging and electrophysiology to aid the development of more accurate spike inference algorithms', 'In a recent challenge , ~40 algorithms were trained and tested on datasets consisting of 37 GCaMP6-expressing neurons , underscoring the need for additional GCaMP6 calibration data ( Berens et al . , 2018 )', 'In addition to supporting efforts toward spike inference , an improved understanding of the relationship between spiking and observed fluorescence signals is necessary to further broaden the utility and impact of calcium imaging . To these ends , we contribute a ground truth dataset consisting of 48 V1 L2/3 excitatory neurons recorded at single-cell resolution ( available at https://portal', 'brain-map . org/explore/circuits/oephys ) and characterized their AP-to-calcium fluorescence transfer function . Complementing existing datasets with viral GECI expression ( Chen et al . , 2013; Theis et al . , 2016; Dana et al', ', 2016 ) , our work facilitates interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging studies using mainstream transgenic mouse lines , such as the Allen Institute’s Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset ( http://observatory . brain-map . org/visualcoding ) ( de Vries et al . , 2020 )', 'Previous studies have established that most APs can be detected with GCaMP6 indicators under near-optimal conditions ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) . Yet undetected APs are common in population imaging experiments ( Theis et al . , 2016; Berens et al . , 2018 )', 'To investigate why APs are often missed during population imaging , we compared event detection in 250 ms time\\xa0windows with a neuronal soma occupying most of the image , near-optimal conditions for AP event detection , and event detection when the soma occupies just a small percentage of the field of view , less ideal conditions that are common in population imaging studies', 'Importantly , we downsampled images to simulate population imaging conditions , enabling comparison for the same APs under different imaging conditions . Our results indicate that , in GCaMP6 transgenic mice , most APs can be detected under near-optimal conditions , while detection is less effective during population imaging', 'These conclusions are similar to those of previous studies with viral GCaMP6 expression , but our results also reveal two reasons for the difference in detection . Unsurprisingly , the reduced signal-to-noise ratio of population imaging , relative to single soma imaging , results in less effective event detection', 'However , a high signal-to-noise ratio , achieved by imaging one soma , was no guarantee of effective event detection . Effective detection also required optimization of detection for the neuron of interest , using known AP times to identify events with different AP numbers and so generate kernels of the appropriate amplitude and time course', 'Parameter tuning in the absence of known AP times , with the MLspike autocalibration routine , improved event detection but not to the high standard of ground truth-optimized detection', 'Unfortunately , measuring AP times for every neuron with electrophysiology is rarely feasible , severely limiting the percentage of events one might reasonably expect to detect with GCaMP6 in most imaging experiments . Our results point to several practices that might be adopted to maximize spike detection . First , minimize the field of view , hence\\xa0maximizing photon flux per neuron', 'Second , tune the spike inference model for each neuron independently , where possible . Third , compare the results of several spike inference models . The three models employed here produced similar AP detection rates , whether applied to high-resolution or to downsampled images . Similarly , Pachitariu et al . , 2018 observed that the L0 constraint failed to improve performance of the NND model', 'Nonetheless , each model has strengths and weaknesses . For example , a model may detect more APs than another but at the cost of a greater false positive rate . As a result , model performance may diverge for some AP rates and patterns . In the worst case , comparing models provides some protection from errors in implementation', 'Fourth , ensure that traces are sampled ( or upsampled ) at a sufficiently high rate when employing NND and use autocalibration with MLspike; both make a substantial difference to model performance . Finally , exercise caution when interpreting the inferred spike rates . Commonly , many APs are not detected using even the most accurate spike inference models', 'In summary , in this study we present a ground truth dataset from anesthetized mice with simultaneous electrophysiology and calcium imaging . Analysis of this dataset revealed that only a small fraction of isolated APs were detected under typical population imaging conditions and with existing spike inference algorithms', 'By making our data freely available , we hope that it will serve the community as a further resource to better understand the quantitative link between calcium-evoked fluorescent imaging signals and spiking activity', 'Two-photon-targeted electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging were conducted in 2-\\xa0to\\xa05-month-old male and female transgenic mice: five Emx1-IRES-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai94 ( Emx1-s ) mice , one Camk2a-tTA;tetO-GCaMP6s ( tetO-s ) mouse , three Emx1-IRES-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 ( Emx1-f ) mice , and four Cux2-CreERT2;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 ( Cux2-f ) mice', 'All four lines drive GCaMP expression primarily in excitatory neurons .

In addition , interconnectivity of CR-ChR2 neurons indicates they form an excitatory network likely to enhance activity within the dorsal horn when recruited', 'The impact of CR-ChR2 photostimulation on the activity of postsynaptic populations was also assessed in current clamp ( Figure 2C , n\\xa0=\\xa022 cells , from 12 animals ) .

Other oIPSC properties were generally similar across neuron types ( Table 1 )', 'Importantly , as both GABA and glycine can mediate fast synaptic inhibition in the dorsal horn , sequential pharmacology was used to differentiate these neurotransmitters', 'Photostimulation-evoked oIPSC responses were isolated by bath application of CNQX ( 10 μM ) and then GABAergic oIPSC components were blocked with bicuculline ( 10 μM ) , before any remaining oIPSCs were abolished with strychnine ( 1 μM ) . Comparison of oIPSCs recorded before and after bicuculline block assessed the contribution of GABA and glycine to these photostimulation responses', 'In this way , an oIPSC amplitude decrease of 80% or greater in bicuculline indicated GABA-dominant input , whereas a decrease of less than 20% in bicuculline indicated a glycine-dominant input . We classified oIPSCs with intermediate bicuculline-sensitivity as mixed ( i . e . both GABAergic and glycinergic )', 'Across all recordings , GABA-dominant responses were most common ( Figure 2F: excitatory- CR-ChR2\\xa0=\\xa072% , plexus\\xa0=\\xa065% , dorsal\\xa0=\\xa058% ) .

While these potentiated responses could result from the specific connectivity patterns in the CR-ChR2 network , they may also relate to direct activation of photocurrents in these neurons , or the magnitude of evoked oEPSC during photostimulation', 'Despite this , there was no correlation between the degree of potentiation and either photocurrent amplitude ( Figure 3C left; r2\\xa0=\\xa00 . 00002 ) or oEPSC amplitude ( Figure 2C right; r2\\xa0=\\xa00 . 056 )', 'Peristimulus histograms ( Figure 3D ) compared CR-ChR2 neuron responses that exhibited increased post-stimulation sEPSC frequency ( n\\xa0=\\xa04 ) with CR-ChR2 neurons that exhibited similar baseline sEPSC frequency but no poststimulation increase ( n\\xa0=\\xa05 )', 'This highlighted the dramatic and prolonged nature of enhanced excitatory synaptic activity in the post-stimulation period , taking\\xa0~20 s before returning to baseline . Together , these results are compatible with a model that features feedback excitation within the ChR2 network , capable of maintaining elevated excitatory signalling beyond the initial excitatory stimulus', 'To further clarify the postsynaptic targets of photostimulated CR-ChR2 neurons , we deeply anesthetized CRCre;Ai32 mice ( n\\xa0=\\xa012 ) and applied direct photostimulation ( 10 mW , 10 ms @ 10 Hz for 10 min ) to the L4/5 spinal segment ( s ) . Animals were maintained under terminal anaesthesia , then perfused transcardially with 4% depolymerised formaldehyde in 0', '1M phosphate buffer 2 hr after onset of stimulation . Spinal cord sections from photostimulated segments were subsequently processed and immunolabelled to visualise the activity marker cFos , YFP ( to label CR-ChR2 cells ) , Pax2 as a marker of inhibitory interneurons ( Smith et al', ', 2015 ) , and three additional neurochemical markers used to differentiate neuronal populations implicated in mechanical pain pathways: Neurokinin one receptor ( NK1R; Mantyh et al . , 1997 ) ; protein kinase C gamma ( PKCγ; Peirs and Seal , 2016 ) , and somatostatin ( SOM; Duan et al . , 2014 )', 'Robust cFos-protein induction was restricted to the dorsal horn ipsilateral to the photostimulation probe , with the extensive mediolateral spread of cFos-IR profiles in this region ( Figure 4A–B )', 'Importantly , no cFos-IR nuclei were found in control animals where identical photostimulation parameters were used in CReGFP mice ( n\\xa0=\\xa03 animals ) , confirming the specificity of photostimulation evoked Fos expression in CRCre;Ai32 mice . Of the cFos-IR profiles , approximately one quarter expressed YFP ( 28', '7%; 254 out of 885 cells; n\\xa0=\\xa012 animals ) and likely reflect that these were activated directly by photostimulation . The remaining cFos-IR neurons represented postsynaptic targets of the CR-ChR2 cells . Approximately 10% of these cells were NK1R-expressing lamina I neurons ( Figure 4C .

M . ±\\xa03 . 4; 16 of 124 cFos-IR cells )', 'In these cells , immunolabelling for NK1R was confined to the cell membrane and showed no evidence of internalisation , from which we conclude that activation of these putative projection neurons results from glutamatergic synaptic input derived from photostimulated excitatory CR-ChR2 interneurons or their postsynaptic targets', 'In contrast , we found no evidence of cFos-expression in cells that were immunolabelled for PKCγ ( 0 of 477 PKCγ-IR cells ) , implying that ChR2-expressing cells in this mouse line do not target this specific population of excitatory interneurons ( Figure 4D ) . Immunolabelling for SOM was present in\\xa0~14% of cFos-IR cell profiles ( 13 . 7%\\xa0±\\xa02', '2; 32 out of 241 ) , however , approximately half of these also expressed YFP ( 50 . 4%\\xa0±\\xa021 . 5; 15 out of 32 ) , consistent with the expected overlap between SOM and CR in lamina II neurons ( Figure 4E ) . Finally , 22% of cFos-expressing cells following spinal photostimulation were identified as inhibitory interneurons ( 21 . 3%\\xa0±\\xa05', '5; 64 out of 291 ) , by the expression of Pax2+ immunolabelling ( Figure 4F ) , of which only\\xa0~10% of these cells expressed YFP ( 10 . 3\\xa0±\\xa09 . 2; total 4 out of 64 ) . This confirms that inhibitory CR-ChR2 neurons are also recruited during the spinal photostimulation protocol , but that these cells are in the minority', 'By extension , a more substantial population of inhibitory interneurons is also engaged by activation of the excitatory CR-ChR2 population . The remaining cFos-expressing cells are most likely to be other unidentified populations of excitatory interneurons due to their absence of Pax2 labelling and may include excitatory CR+ neurons that did not express ChR2-YFP ( Figure 4G )', 'The relative recruitment of each neurochemically defined population was also calculated yielding: 8 . 4% of all CR-ChR2 neurons ( 254 of 3014 YFP-IR neurons ) , 21% of all NK1R+ neurons ( 16 of 75 neurons ) , 5 . 5% of all SOM+ neurons ( 32 of 584 neurons ) , 0% of all PKCγ+ neurons ( 0 of 477 neurons ) , and 15 . 3% of all Pax2+ neurons ( 64 of 418 neurons )', 'Taken together , these data show that activation of the CR-ChR2 network selectively recruits a diverse range of excitatory interneurons , inhibitory interneurons , and projection neurons . Current models for dorsal horn microcircuitry place CR neurons in a polysynaptic circuit that signals through SOM neurons to activate lamina I projection neurons and initiate pain signalling ( Peirs et al', ', 2015 ) . Our data is compatible with this model since CR-ChR2 photostimulation evoked oEPSCs in dorsal horn neurons , including populations located superficial to the YFP plexus', 'This was verified further in our activity mapping data as photoactivation of CR-ChR2 cells produced robust cFos expression in CR-IR neurons , SOM-expressing interneurons , and putative NK1R-expressing projection neurons in lamina I ( Figure 4C ) . Since extensive co-localisation of CR and SOM has been reported in laminae I-III previously ( Gutierrez-Mecinas et al', ', 2016 ) , it remained to be clarified how CR network activity reached projection neurons . This issue was addressed using a neuroanatomical approach with CRCre mice crossed with a loxP-flanked- Synaptophysin-tdTomato reporter line ( Ai34 ) to generate CRCre;Ai34 offspring where tdTomato labelled synaptic vesicles in CR-expressing cells', 'Tissue from these animals ( n\\xa0=\\xa03 animals ) was processed for immunocytochemistry to identify putative lamina I projection neurons using NK1R expression , excitatory synapses using Homer1 immunolabelling , and SOM expression to help assess CR only , SOM only , or CR/SOM inputs ( Figure 4H–I ) . Using this strategy , ~30% ( 31 . 5%; SD =±3', '5 ) of all Homer puncta on NK1R dendrites were derived from CR terminals , 4 . 2% ( ±0 . 89 ) were associated with CR only inputs , and 27 . 3% ( ±3 . 63 ) were associated with boutons expressing both CR and SOM .

In this analysis , we found that 68 . 9% ( ±6', '6 ) of all Homer puncta on NK1R-expressing dendrites in lamina I associate with VGLUT2 terminals ( Figure 4J–L ) , and that most VGLUT2-IR boutons on NK1R dendrites co-expressed SOM ( 78 . 9%\\xa0±\\xa06 . 28 ) .

Only 2 of 167 GFP axon terminals in lamina I exhibited co-expression , and conversely only 4 of 304 boutons that were immunolabelled for both SOM and VGLUT2 express GFP', 'Together , these data confirm that CR interneurons provide substantial monosynaptic excitatory input to NK1R neurons , and that most of these terminals also express SOM . We conclude that CR and SOM interneurons represent the principal source of excitatory input to NK1R neurons in lamina I', 'Given clear neuroanatomical evidence that CR neurons provided input to lamina I projection neurons ( PNs ) above , the functional impact of these connections was assessed', 'CRCre;Ai32 animals ( n\\xa0=\\xa02 ) received bilateral intracranial virus injections of AAV9-CB7-Cl\\xa0~\\xa0mCherry in the parabrachial nuclei and then following a 3–4 week incubation period spinal cord slices were prepared for targeted recordings from mCherry-labelled PNs', 'Under these conditions , brief full-field photostimulation ( 16 mW , 1 ms ) applied to activate CR-ChR2 neurons produced oEPSCs in PNs that were blocked by bath applied CNQX ( 10 μM , n\\xa0=\\xa05 ) . oEPSCs were observed in 65% of these recordings ( 13/20 ) indicating clear connectivity between the ChR2-YFP population and PNs ( Figure 5A )', 'These responses could be differentiated into single oEPSC events ( 8/13 ) and multiple oEPSC responses ( 5/13 ) .

The strength of CR-ChR2 to PN connections was also assessed in current clamp where photostimulation-mediated oEPSPs were capable of evoking an action potential in\\xa0~70% of PNs ( 5/7 ) , with a reliability of 0 . 675 ( ie , 67 . 5% chance of a suprathreshold AP response )', 'Neuroanatomical support of direct ChR2-YFP derived input to PNs was also obtained in 3 of 5 PNs that were Neurobiotin recovered , where clear YFP puncta were identified in close apposition to Neurobiotin labelled dendrites ( Figure 5B )', 'Together , these results demonstrate a functionally relevant monosynaptic connection exists between CR-ChR2 neurons and PNs , and is capable of recruiting PN discharge . In light of this connectivity , the impact of repeated CR-ChR2 neuron photostimulation was also assessed to determine if this pathway supported the enhanced signalling seen in the ChR2-YFP network ( see Figure 2 )', 'Under these conditions\\xa0~\\xa060% of PNs tested ( 5/8 ) exhibited significant and sustained responses during extended ChR2 photostimulation ( 10 s @ 10 Hz , 10 ms pulses at 16 mW ) , defined as an increase in four standard deviations above the mean background sEPSC frequency ( Figure 5C ) . This increase reflected the stimulation features ( i . e', ', approximately 10 Hz increase ) and took\\xa0~20 s to return to baseline ( Figure 5D ) . In contrast , the remaining PNs still exhibited ChR2 input but did not show sustained responses ( 3/8 )', 'In conclusion , these results confirm that strong signalling arising from the CR-ChR2 network reaches PNs , the output cell of the dorsal horn , and therefore drive substantial output signals to higher brain regions in the ascending pain pathway', 'The functional significance of CR-ChR2 neuron connectivity and activation within the dorsal horn was tested by chronically implanting a fibre optic probe over the surface of the dorsal spinal cord in CRCre;Ai32 mice for subsequent photostimulation', 'Following surgery , a cohort of CRCre;Ai32 ( n\\xa0=\\xa025 ) animals was assessed , and shown to exhibit clear nocifensive behaviour initiated at the onset of photostimulation ( 10 mW , 10 ms pulses @ 10 Hz for 10 s ) and outlasting the photostimulation period ( Figure 6A )', 'In contrast , photostimulation in a cohort of fibre optic probe implanted CReGFP ( n\\xa0=\\xa09 ) animals did not produce photostimulation time-locked behaviours , although random grooming bouts were occasionally observed ( Figure 6A ) . This data followed a series of preliminary set of experiments where behavioural responses were tested using a range of photostimulation intensities ( 0', '5–20 mW , 10 ms pulses @ 10 Hz for 10 s; Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B ) , which produced clear behavioural responses ( Video 1 ) . Specifically , responses were characterized by targeted nocifensive behaviour including paw lifting and licking/biting , typically focussed to the hind-paw or hind-limb region', 'The intensity and duration of these responses increased with photostimulation intensity until 10 mW and then stabilised above this ( n\\xa0=\\xa05 , Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B ) . Thus , a photostimulation intensity of 10 mW was adopted for subsequent experiments , unless otherwise noted', 'To also exclude the potential for a contribution of primary afferent signalling to behavioural responses ( eg , via axon reflex ) , photostimulation was also assessed while the responses area ( hindpaw ) was under local anaesthesia ( n\\xa0=\\xa04 , Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–D )', 'Surprisingly , photostimulation responses during local hindpaw anaesthesia ( 2% lidocaine ) increased above baseline ( control ) responses ( 54\\xa0±\\xa013 s vs . 34\\xa0±\\xa04 s , p=0 . 05 ) , whereas response durations during vehicle hindpaw injection were similar to controls ( 35\\xa0±\\xa010 s vs . 34\\xa0±\\xa04 s , p=0 . 86 )', 'This outcome is consistent with gating models of spinal sensory processing that highlight the capacity of innocuous tactile input ( such as those activated by nocifensive behavioural responses during photostimulation ) engaging inhibitory pathways that supress nociceptive signalling in the dorsal horn', 'Local anaesthesia removes this gating , allowing photostimulation evoked nociceptive signalling to continue and prolonging behavioural responses', 'Given the sustained nature of post-photostimulation nocifensive responses , the potential for subsequent responses to be enhanced by prior CR-ChR2 activation was investigated by delivering two successive 10 s bouts of photostimulation , separated by 120 s ( Figure 6B , n\\xa0=\\xa09 animals ) . Under these conditions the second photostimulation response was significantly longer lasting than the first ( 56', '26\\xa0±\\xa010 . 09 s vs . 66 . 16\\xa0±\\xa09 . 95 s p=0 . 005; Figure 6B ) . This mirrored the observation that some CR-ChR2 neurons received sustained levels of excitatory signalling for a period following recruitment in vitro ( Figure 3 ) , and this signal reaches lamina I PNs ( Figure 5 )', 'To further explore summation of the CR-ChR2 network activity , short trains of subthreshold photostimuli ( which failed to elicit behavioural responses ) were delivered at two frequencies ( 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 Hz ) . Photostimulation intensities that did not evoke behavioural responses during 1 s of stimulation ( 10 ms pulses at 10 Hz ) were first established for each animal ( n\\xa0=\\xa06 , 0 . 72\\xa0±\\xa00', '36 mW , range 0 . 1–2 mW ) . This stimulus was then repeated once every 10 s over 1 min ( 0 . 1 Hz ) , and once every 2 s for 12 s ( 0 . 5 Hz ) , altering the window for summation and associated behavioural responses without changing the total energy used to activate ChR2-YFP neurons ( Figure 6C ) . These trains of stimuli reliably evoked behavioural responses at both frequencies ( 0 . 1 and 0', '5 Hz ) despite the absence of responses to single stimuli . The response characteristics differed , however , in that the response latency for 0 . 1 Hz stimulation was significantly longer than for the higher frequency ( 0 . 5 Hz ) protocol ( 11 . 83\\xa0±\\xa02 . 41 ms vs . 2 . 00\\xa0±\\xa00 . 82 ms , p=0 . 012 )', 'The relationship between stimulation frequency and total response was more varied with 5/6 animals exhibiting longer responses for the higher frequency stimulation ( 0 . 5 Hz ) but response duration falling in one animal . Thus , response duration was statistically similar in both stimulation frequencies ( 20 . 57\\xa0±\\xa06 . 31 ms vs . 28 . 73\\xa0±\\xa01 . 86 ms , p=0 . 218 )', 'This may be explained by the altered photostimulation frequency also changing the total stimulation duration . Regardless , these multiple stimulation paradigms reinforce the ability of CR-ChR2 neuron networks to retain subthreshold and suprathreshold excitation within an integration window that can influence the characteristics of subsequent responses', 'Another pronounced feature of the CR-ChR2-evoked photostimulation response was the dynamic nature of the area targeted for nocifensive behaviour beyond the initial ( primary ) body region . This observation was characterized in a subset of animals ( n\\xa0=\\xa018 ) where the initial response was directed at the right hind paw , allowing similar comparisons across multiple animals ( Figure 6D )', 'In this analysis , the onset of nocifensive responses directed to the right paw , right hind limb , back , and tail were measured , revealing a stereotypic progression of the nocifensive response across dermatomes . Comparison of the latency to nocifensive responses at each dermatome reinforced this stereotyped behaviour ( right paw\\xa0=\\xa01 . 25\\xa0±\\xa00 . 22 s vs . right hind limb\\xa0=\\xa026 . 42\\xa0±\\xa09 . 11 s vs', 'back\\xa0=\\xa040 . 83\\xa0±\\xa010 . 78 s vs . tail\\xa0=\\xa059 . 29\\xa0±\\xa018 . 32 s , p=0 . 003; Figure 6D ) . Thus , in addition to sustaining excitation beyond photostimulation , optogenetic activation of the CR-ChR2 neuron network produced sensory signalling that spread to adjacent dermatomes before subsiding', 'Although CR-ChR2 photostimulation responses appeared nociceptive ‘pain-like’ in quality , additional analysis was needed to support this interpretation', 'First , Fos-protein activity mapping assessed the distinct distribution of cFos-expressing neurons in the brains of CRCre;Ai32 ( n\\xa0=\\xa05 ) versus CReGFP ( n\\xa0=\\xa05 ) mice following a single bout of spinal photostimulation ( 10 mW 10 ms pulses @ 10 Hz for 10 s )', 'Specifically , robust cFos expression was detected in the somatosensory cortex ( S1 ) , cingulate cortex , insular cortex , and parabrachial nucleus ( PBN ) of CRCre;Ai32 mice ( Figure 7 ) . This expression pattern was significantly elevated above the CReGFP control group ( S1 p=0 . 043 , cingulate p=0 . 016 , insula p=0 . 035 , and PBN p=0 . 023 )', 'Neuronal activity in these regions is consistent with nociceptive signalling being relayed along the neuroaxis , mirroring the pronounced nocifensive responses observed during in vivo photostimulation', 'Given nocifensive responses should also be sensitive to analgesia , a group of CRCre;Ai32 animals ( n\\xa0=\\xa05 ) also underwent photostimulation during a randomized schedule of varying degrees of morphine analgesia ( 3 mg/kg , 10 mg/kg , or 30 mg/kg morphine s . c; or vehicle only injection of saline , s . c . )', 'Identical photostimulation was delivered under each condition ( 10 mW , 10 ms pulses @ 10 Hz for 10 s ) and behavioural responses analysed to provide a robust assessment of analgesic sensitivity ( Figure 8A ) . Morphine produced a dose dependent reduction in the photostimulation-induced nocifensive behaviour , which was abolished at the highest morphine dose ( 30 mg/kg )', 'This reinforces the nocifensive nature of the circuits activated during CR-ChR2 photostimulation . While the above data shows CR-ChR2 photostimulation was sufficient to evoke responses consistent with nociceptive pain , this did not confirm necessity of the CR-ChR2 network in sensory-evoked responses', 'Thus , a photoinhibition approach was also employed by crossing CRCre mice with loxP-flanked-NpHR3YFP mice ( Ai39 ) to generate offspring where halorhodopsin ( NpHR3YFP ) was expressed in CR+ neurons ( CRCre;Ai39 ) . To validate YFP expression in CR cells , we assessed the incidence of co-expression of these markers in spinal neurons in laminae I and II ( n\\xa0=\\xa03 animals ) . We found that 82', '2% ( ±1 . 27 ) of YFP-expressing cells were immunopositive for CR ( 967 YFP cells analysed; range 281 , 316 and 370 cells per animal; Figure 8—figure supplement 1A ) , and that 94 . 1% ( ±4 . 27 ) of CR-IR cells expressed YFP ( 225 CR-IR cells analysed; 58 , 78 and 89 cells per animal )', 'Furthermore , full-field illumination ( 590 nM , 20 mW ) evoked prominent outward currents consistent with a NpHR3-mediated potassium conductance ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1B ) . NpHR3-mediated photoinhibition of AP discharge was confirmed by comparing NpHR3 neuron spiking responses to depolarizing current injection with and without photoinhibition ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1C )', 'Under these conditions photoinhibition increased the rheobase current required to activate AP spiking and decreased the number of APs evoked during increasing current steps ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1C ) . Since chemogenic activation of CR neurons has been show to lower mechanical but not thermal thresholds ( Peirs et al', ', 2015 ) , we assessed the responsiveness of CRCre;Ai39 mice to mechanical stimulation during NpHR3-mediated photoinhibition in vivo . Mice ( n\\xa0=\\xa08 ) were implanted with spinal fibre optic probes and underwent mechanical threshold testing using von Frey filaments ( Figure 8B ) . Photoinhibition significantly increased paw withdrawal thresholds on the ipsilateral ( photoinhibited ) hind paw ( 0', '19\\xa0±\\xa00 . 02 g vs . 0 . 29\\xa0±\\xa00 . 04 g , p=0 . 017 ) but not contralateral side ( 0 . 18\\xa0±\\xa00 . 02 g vs . 0 . 19\\xa0±\\xa00 . 03 g , p=0 . 721 ) , supporting a role for the CR+ network in processing of noxious tactile sensation', 'The relative potency and valence of spinal photostimulation was assessed in a group of CRCre;Ai32 animals ( n\\xa0=\\xa013 ) with spinal fibre optic probes implanted that subsequently underwent conditioned place aversion testing ( Figure 8C–D )', 'Baseline preference for each animal was determined in a two-arena enclosure without photostimulation , and the preferred arena was then assigned for photostimulation ( 10 mW 10 ms pulses @ 10 Hz for 10 s in every min ) . Animals were subsequently tested for a real-time place aversion ( RT-PA ) over four sessions , i . e . learned avoidance of the photostimulation arena ( Video 2 )', 'Animals that exhibited a strong RT-PA on the last two sessions , defined as a 50% reduction from baseline in time spent in photostimulation area , were subsequently tested for a traditional conditioned place aversion ( CPA ) 1 hr ( short term ) and 24 hr ( long term ) after the last RT-PA session ( 9/13 animals )', 'Importantly , no photostimulation was delivered during this CPA testing , instead assessing the aversive nature of photostimulation recall . In short term CPA testing ( ST-CPA ) , animals retained a significant aversion to the previous photostimulation arena compared to baseline ( 363\\xa0±\\xa015 s vs . 72\\xa0±\\xa025 s , p=0 . 0001 )', 'Likewise , in long term CPA testing ( LT-CPA ) aversion to the previous photostimulation arena was still apparent 24 hr after RT-PA ( 363\\xa0±\\xa015 s vs . 89\\xa0±\\xa031 s , p=0 . 0001 )', 'In summary , all CPA testing revealed a clear preference for the no-photostimulation arena , with behavioural traces also suggesting that animals spent more time stationary in this area ( Figure 8C ) , potentially reflecting freezing behaviour during these tests . Thus , spinal photostimulation of the ChR2 population produced a potent sensory experience with a strong and lasting negative valence', 'Finally , to assess a potential role for the CR-network in pathological pain processing , in vivo photostimulation responses were assessed in a group of CRCre;Ai32 animals ( n\\xa0=\\xa04 ) before and after spared nerve injury surgery ( Figure 8E–H ) . Importantly , this analysis only included animals with photostimulation responses directed to the hind paw including the spared ( sural nerve ) territory', 'As expected , SNI reduced ipsilateral hind paw mechanical withdrawal thresholds at days 5 and 12 post-surgery ( SNId5 and SNId12 ) , consistent with the development of neuropathic mechanical allodynina ( Figure 8F ) . Regarding in vivo photostimulation , these animals exhibited robust nocifensive responses at baseline ( pre-SNI surgery ) that were comparable to previous experiments', 'Following SNI , however , the duration of photostimulation responses was significantly elevated ( 50 . 55\\xa0±\\xa010 . 91 s vs . 97 . 06\\xa0±\\xa020 . 40 s and 72 . 43\\xa0±\\xa07 . 08 s , baseline vs .

SNId5 and SNId12; n\\xa0=\\xa02 ) . \\n Our in vitro electrophysiology showed that CR-ChR2 neurons exhibit diverse functional excitatory synaptic connections within the dorsal horn', 'A surprising finding in this work was the high degree of interconnectivity between CR-ChR2 cells , establishing an excitatory network that when recruited , could substantially enhance excitation in the dorsal horn ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . This is in line with observations using viral-mediated excitatory DREADD-expression to activate CR neurons selectively ( Peirs et al . , 2015 )', 'This work showed that CNO exposure activated a substantial proportion of transduced DREADD-positive CR neurons ( 30% ) , however , an additional large proportion of DREADD-negative CR neurons ( 45% ) were also activated . This observation supports the capacity of CR neuron recruitment to drive activation of the wider CR network', 'Such interconnectivity in a neurochemically defined population has been described for another dorsal horn population identified by expression of neurotensin ( Hachisuka et al . , 2018 ) , although this work did not go on to demonstrate the functional relevance in behaving animals', 'Nevertheless , this work highlighted how interconnected excitatory networks could potentiate excitatory signaling in the dorsal horn . Likewise , similar arrangements of interconnected neuronal networks have been reported in other CNS regions , albeit typically involving inhibitory populations ( Tamás et al . , 2000; Meyer et al . , 2002; Woodruff and Sah , 2007 )', 'This interconnectivity among excitatory interneurons suggests the CR-ChR2 network we have targeted here represents a potent source of excitatory signaling that could amplify afferent input in the dorsal horn', 'CRACM experiments also showed that input from CR-ChR2 neurons is widespread , with other neurons located in the YFP-expressing plexus as well as more dorsal populations , receiving short and longer latency input following CR-ChR2 activation', 'These experiments also confirmed that lamina I projection neurons , which often received convergent , multicomponent inputs and more reliably discharged APs in response to this input than other populations , are also a target of these cells . These features are consistent with CR-ChR2 neurons initiating excitation that converges on projection neurons', 'Such excitatory relays have been proposed in the dorsal horn as a substrate for allodynia , where low threshold mechanical inputs are transmitted into nociceptive circuits ( Torsney and MacDermott , 2006; Miraucourt et al . , 2007; Neumann et al . , 2008; Peirs et al . , 2015; Boyle et al', ', 2019 ) , as well as feed forward circuits that supplement excitation during nociceptive processing ( Lu and Perl , 2005; Lu et al . , 2013 )', 'For example , under pathological conditions CR neurons have been reported to receive low-threshold ( Aβ afferent ) input via a population of lamina III neurons that transiently express VGLUT3 and relay this information into nociceptive circuits ( Peirs et al . , 2015 )', 'This work also used cFos labelling and DREADD silencing of various populations to propose a circuit connecting CR neurons to projection neurons in lamina I via polysynaptic connections that included an interposed population of SOM interneurons', 'In support of this proposal , we find approximately 30% of all excitatory input to lamina I projection neurons are derived from axons of CR interneurons ( Figure 4 ) , of which a significant proportion also express SOM ( 86 . 5%;±3 . 17 )', 'These findings demonstrate that CR neurons provide considerable direct input to the lamina I projection neuron population , and when considered alongside the CR-ChR2 network interconnectivity , these have the potential to greatly influence spinal sensory outputs', 'Our findings are in agreement with previous studies which have reported that CR interneurons activate SOM-expressing interneurons , but not those that express PKCγ ( Peirs et al . , 2015 ) , and we also demonstrate that CR-expressing interneurons can recruit lamina I projection neurons either directly , or via polysynaptic circuit incorporating SOM neurons ( Figure 4 )', 'It is important to note that methodological approaches may account for subtle differences in the circuitry we define compared to those studies where intraspinal injections of cre-dependent viruses have been used ( Peirs et al', ', 2015 ) , however , the fidelity of the YFP expression we see in CR immunolabelled cells in our CRCre;Ai32 mice is nonetheless similar to those reported in spinally-injected animals ( Peirs et al . , 2015 )', 'The pattern of YFP expression , absence of YFP labelling in neurochemically-defined sensory afferents in laminae I-IV and the absence of NK1R-internalisation in lamina I cells following in vivo photo-stimulation , support the view that aberrant recruitment of primary afferents does not occur in our experiments', 'Rather , behavioral responses and spinal activation profiles result from the central activation of ChR2-expressing cells', 'In summary , the interconnectivity of CR neurons , combined with the postsynaptic circuitry we have identified provides a mechanism to relay low threshold input into nociceptive circuits ( allodynia ) , and provide additional excitation during nociceptive processing ( hyperalgesia ) through reverberating patterns of excitation', 'Inhibitory signaling has been also a central element in models of spinal sensory processing since publication of the gate control theory and contemporary work from a number of groups has since identified several critical inhibitory populations ( Duan et al . , 2014; Foster et al . , 2015; Petitjean et al . , 2015; Cui et al . , 2016 )', 'Consistent with these views , our cFos mapping also supports a role for the CR network in engaging inhibitory interneurons . These inhibitory circuits may be important for modality coding by suppressing selective populations while the CR circuits are active ( Zeilhofer et al . , 2012; Price and Prescott , 2015 )', 'Such inhibition is known to act in other sensory systems to refine receptive field characteristics and a similar constraint over the activation of CR neurons would fit such a model ( Woolf and Fitzgerald , 1983; Kato et al . , 2011 )', 'Finally , ongoing inhibition can tune sensory thresholds , as demonstrated in several studies where diminished inhibition has been shown to lead to pathological conditions such as chronic pain and itch ( Moore et al . , 2002; Coull et al . , 2003; Zeilhofer , 2005; Ross et al . , 2010 )', 'An important distinction between the current study and previous work is that the inhibition evoked in our study is driven exclusively by recruitment of CR spinal interneurons , rather than as a result of primary afferent drive . Thus , the CR related microcircuits appear to have an in-built mechanism to limit the outcome of their activity under control conditions', 'By extension , any reduction to this inhibition would unmask added excitation with dorsal horn circuits with relevance to many pathological conditions that feature aberrant excitation . We show that CR network evoked inhibition is widespread in the dorsal horn , with a range of latencies that indicate both direct and indirect circuits are engaged ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2D )', 'Direct inhibition is not surprising given we have previously described a small inhibitory CR population ( Smith et al . , 2015 ) , and show here that they express ChR2 in the CRCre;Ai32 animals used . These neurons are directly activated during spinal photostimulation and therefore provide the only source of short latency monosynaptic inhibition', 'In contrast , secondary recruitment of other inhibitory populations by the excitatory CR neurons produces longer latency polysynaptic inhibition . Previous work has shown dynophin-expressing neurons provide important gating inhibition to somatostatin neurons ( Duan et al', ', 2014 ) , and given the overlap between somatostatin and CR , dynorphin cells are therefore one candidate population for the polysynaptic inhibition observed here . Similarly , GABAergic enkephalin neurons have recently been implicated in gating mechanical pain ( François et al . , 2017 ) and thus may also contribute to CR network evoked inhibition', 'The behavioral consequence of experimentally activating CR circuits in vivo is striking , with a targeted and multifaceted nocifensive response ( paw licking , biting , lifting , and shaking ) directed to dermatomes predicted by the location of fiber optic implant and initiated upon photostimulation', 'This response profile is consistent with our previous work showing that CR neurons respond maximally to noxious mechanical stimulation , with some activation also resulting from hindpaw injection of capsaicin ( Smith et al . , 2015 )', 'CR neuron photostimulation responses also resemble reports from two other groups that have applied spinal photostimulation to populations of dorsal horn neurons ( Christensen et al . , 2016; Bonin et al . , 2016 ) . The most relevant assessed excitatory somatostatin neurons , reporting photostimulation produced abrupt nocifensive behavior and a conditioned place aversion ( Christensen et al', ', 2016 ) . This conserved behavioral profile is again consistent with the overlap in somatostatin and CR populations studied and the postsynaptic position of somatostatin neurons relative to the CR population . An additional observation in the somatostatin photostimulation study was the presence of itch related behaviors', 'We confirmed the nociceptive nature of CR photostimulation by demonstrating selective cFos labelling in distinct pain processing brain nuclei as well as sensitivity of the photostimulation responses to morphine ( Figures 7 and 8 ) . We observed a dose dependent inhibition of photostimulation related behavior that was abolished at the highest morphine dose', 'Morphine is a prototypical analgesic but does not have antipruritic actions , with intrathecal administration known to induce itch ( Lui and Ng , 2011 ) . Furthermore , we did not see scratching responses in our experiments , however , future studies employing specific itch assays would be required to further validate these observations', 'It is worth noting that a small number of inhibitory CR neurons were also activated during photostimulation ( Figure 4G ) . Previous optogenetic manipulation of inhibitory populations in the dorsal horn has only been reported using archaerhodopsin , which produced a predictable decrease in sensory thresholds ( Bonin et al . , 2016 )', 'The related approach of chemogenetic activation has , however , been applied to activate parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn , demonstrating an increase in sensory thresholds as well as an attenuation of nerve injury induced allodynia ( Petitjean et al . , 2015 )', 'Taken together , these results support the well-established role of inhibitory populations in suppressing spinal nociceptive signaling and suggest the recruitment of some inhibitory CR neurons in our experiments will have had minimal effects on the robust behavioral outcomes attributed to the excitatory CR population', 'Furthermore , we show that halorhodopsin-mediated inhibition of the CR population increased mechanical withdrawal thresholds , consistent with a result that would be predicted for inactivation of an inhibitory population from the above work . Three behavioral observations during CR neuron photostimulation warrant further discussion', 'First , behavioral responses persisted well beyond the termination of photostimulation ( Figure 6A ) . This observation was paralleled by a sustained increased in spontaneous excitatory activity in CR neurons and LI projection neurons under extended in vitro photostimulation conditions , indicating this excitatory network can sustain excitatory activity following recruitment', 'Second , behavioral responses to repeated photostimulation were enhanced , indicating short-term plasticity within the CR network ( Figure 6B–C ) . Previous work has focused largely on plasticity between primary afferents and dorsal horn populations ( Baba et al . , 2001; Luo et al', ', 2014 ) , whereas our findings extend our understanding to show plasticity also occurs within intrinsic dorsal horn circuits . Finally , photostimulation responses showed a predictable pattern that initially saw nocifensive behavior focused on a specific body region ( commonly the paw ) but then progressed over a number of adjacent dermatomes ( Figure 6D )', 'This coupled with spinal cFos activation patterns , which extended over the mediolateral extent of the dorsal horn ( Figure 4A–B ) , suggest the excitatory CR network provides a pathway to spread excitation across normal dermatome boundaries . Similarly , though not examined here , photostimulation responses imply that the CR network may also facilitate a rostrocaudal spread of activation', 'Together , these observations extend on the current view of excitatory interneurons in spinal sensory processing , which ascribes a relative limited role of linking low threshold modality ( innocuous ) tactile input to excite more dorsal nociceptive circuitry ( Duan et al . , 2014; Peirs and Seal , 2016; Yu et al . , 2017 )', 'We suggest these neurons also provide a polysynaptic network to enhance/amplify local excitation , prime the region for subsequent responses , and spread excitatory signaling across modality borders . Though not directly assessed , the cellular mechanisms that underpin these observations likely relate to a number of properties in the interconnected CR network', 'Specifically , CR neurons in this region , as well as the majority of their targets , had an excitatory phenotype and were coupled by excitatory synapses ( Figure 2 and 4 ) . Thus , strong activation of this network likely established reverberatory activity among these circuits as proposed by others ( Hachisuka et al', ', 2018 ) , as well as potentially inducing short term plasticity at these interconnected synapses', 'In vitro recordings of enhanced synaptic signaling in CR neurons and LI projection neurons following photostimulation ( Figure 3 and 5 ) certainly support this explanation , however , future work will be required to assess the relative importance of these observations to extended behavioural responses', 'The results from this study confirm that CR neurons form an excitatory dorsal horn network that contributes to spinal pain signaling and can amplify pain signals in the absence of peripheral input', 'The strong interconnectivity of this neurochemially-defined subpopulation in the dorsal horn means they are ideally positioned to alter incoming sensory information prior to its relay to higher brain centers . This capacity is clearly demonstrated in the nocifensive responses elicited by spinal photostimulation', 'Importantly , however , our work has largely focused on characterizing CR microcircuits and establishing their functional roles in sensory experience by experimental activation using optogenetics . Future work must continue to determine how these circuits respond during peripherally evoked sensory processing , as we have here using halorhodopsin', 'Finally , our data in SNI animals suggest CR networks change under neuropathic conditions to become more excitable ( Figure 8E–H ) . The question of how pathology and injury can recruit or alter these CR circuits will also be critical for determining how they contribute to symptoms of pathological pain , and how best to target them for therapeutic benefit', 'Optogenetic studies were carried out on mice derived by crossing Calb2-IRES-cre ( Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbor , USA; #010774 ) with either Ai32 ( Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbor , USA; #024109 ) or Ai39 ( Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbor , USA , #014539 ) to generate offspring where ChR2/YFP or NpHR/YFP was expressed in CR+ cells ( CRCre;Ai32 or CRCre;Ai39 )', 'Axon terminal labelling experiments crossed Calb2-IRES-cre and Ai34D ( Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbour , USA , # 012570 ) mice to generate offspring with CR+ axon terminals labelled with TdTomato . In control experiments , another transgenic mouse line with enhanced green fluorescent protein expressed under the control of the calretinin ( Calb2 ) promoter ( CReGFP ) was used ( Caputi et al', ', 2009 ) . All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the University of Newcastle’s animal care and ethics committee ( protocols A-2013–312 and A-2016–603 ) . Animals of both sexes were used for electrophysiology ( age: 3–12 months ) and behavior experiments ( age: 8–12 weeks ) . Acute spinal cord slices were prepared using previously described methods ( Graham et al', ', 2003; Graham et al . , 2011 ) . Briefly , animals were anaesthetized with ketamine ( 100 mg/kg i . p ) and decapitated . The ventral surface of the vertebral column was exposed and the spinal cord rapidly dissected in ice-cold sucrose substituted cerebrospinal fluid ( ACSF ) containing ( in mM ) : 250 sucrose , 25 NaHCO3 , 10 glucose , 2 . 5 KCl , 1 NaH2PO4 , 1 MgCl and 2 . 5 CaCl2', 'Either parasagittal or transverse slices were prepared ( lumbar segments L1 to 5 , 200 µm thick: LI-L5 300 μm thick , respectively ) both using a vibrating microtome ( Campden Instruments 7000 smz , Loughborough , UK ) .

Spatially restricting gene expression by regulating local translation rather than by directing the delivery of mRNAs from nucleus to stimulated synapses maximizes the readiness of the entire neuronal arbor to respond to local cues', 'Synapse formation and long-lasting experience-dependent synaptic plasticity require new RNA and protein synthesis ( Kandel , 2001; Kalinovsky and Scheiffele , 2004 ) . Neurons are dramatically polarized and compartmentalized cells , elaborating axonal and dendritic processes that extend long distances and forming thousands of synaptic connections with other neurons', 'This polarity and compartmentalization poses challenges to the spatial regulation of gene expression during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity: how can the products of gene expression be restricted to specific synapses undergoing activity-dependent changes in structure and function ? Many studies have demonstrated that mRNAs that constitutively localize to axonal growth cones in immature neurons and to dendrites in mature neurons undergo stimulus-induced translation , demonstrating that regulated translation of localized mRNAs provides one mechanism of spatially restricting neuronal gene expression ( Aakalu et al', ', 2001; Job and Eberwine , 2001; Leung et al . , 2006; Lyles et al . , 2006; Smith et al . , 2005; Tsokas et al . , 2005; Wang et al . , 2009; Zheng et al . , 2001 ) . Here , we set out to determine whether , in addition to regulating compartmentalized translation , local stimulation also regulates RNA trafficking from the soma to the synapse', 'We considered that the regulated trafficking of stimulus-induced transcripts from nucleus to stimulated synapse would provide a means of directly coupling the requirement for transcription with the requirement for local translation during synapse formation and plasticity', 'A number of findings indicate that the persistence of long-term plasticity requires not only translation but also transcription . For example , transcriptional inhibitors block late-phase LTP of rodent hippocampal synapses ( Frey et al . , 1996; Nguyen et al . , 1994 ) and long-term facilitation ( LTF ) of Aplysia sensory-motor synapses ( Montarolo et al', ', 1986 ) , indicating that translation of pre-existing localized mRNAs is not sufficient for late-LTP in hippocampus or for the persistence of LTF in Aplysia', 'Similarly , when isolated Aplysia sensory neurites , severed from their somata , are paired with motor neurons , they undergo a form of serotonin ( 5HT ) -induced LTF that does not last as long as the LTF in cultures containing intact SNs ( Grabham et al . , 2005 ) . Together these studies demonstrate that newly transcribed mRNAs are required for persistent synaptic plasticity', 'This led us to ask whether , in addition to regulating local translation , synaptic stimulation regulates the trafficking of RNAs from the nucleus to specific subcellular sites . Consistent with the possibility of stimulus-induced control of RNA trafficking , previous studies have reported that activity can regulate the localization of mRNAs within neurons', 'For example , depolarization has been shown to increase the dendritic localization of several mRNAs , including those encoding beta-actin ( Tiruchinapalli et al . , 2003 ) , BDNF , and TrkB ( Tongiorgi et al . , 1997 ) , while incubation with DHPG has been shown to increase the dendritic localization of the AMPA glutamate receptor GluA2 ( Grooms et al . , 2006 )', 'Similarly , neurotrophins have been reported to regulate the concentration of specific mRNAs in axons of regenerating adult sensory neurons ( Willis et al . , 2007 ) . Neuronal activity also induces transcription of genes whose transcripts are subsequently transported into dendrites , including for example the immediate early gene Arc ( Link et al . , 1995; Lyford et al . , 1995 )', 'In situ hybridization images of the bclw transcript in a recent study from Cosker et al ( 2013 ) indicated that the mRNA localized to peripheral but not central axons of DRG neurons , suggesting that neurons are capable of directing transcripts from the soma to subsets of processes', 'Together , these findings suggest that RNAs may undergo activity-dependent transport from the nucleus to locally stimulated subcellular compartments . In this study , we directly monitored RNA targeting from the soma to stimulated synapses during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity', 'To examine synapse formation , we cultured a single bifurcated Aplysia SN with a target ( L7 ) MN , with which it formed glutamatergic synapses , and a non-target ( L11 ) MN , with which it fasciculated but did not form chemical synapses ( Glanzman et al . , 1990 )', 'To study RNA localization during synapse-specific plasticity , we cultured bifurcated SNs with two target MNs and locally perfused 5HT onto the connection with one MN to produce synapse-specific LTF', 'We asked whether and how stimuli regulate RNA and protein localization and concentration by analyzing the distribution of ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) , messenger RNA ( mRNA ) , RNA binding proteins , and translation factors', 'We found that rRNA , three specific mRNAs , ribosomal proteins , and translation factors were delivered throughout the SN , to both synaptic and non-synaptic sites , but that translation was significantly enriched at sites of synaptic contact and at sites of synaptic stimulation', 'These results indicate that the spatial regulation of gene expression in Aplysia sensory-motor neurons is mediated primarily at the level of translation rather than at the level of RNA targeting from the nucleus . These results , together with our previous study ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) suggested the existence of a trans-synaptic signal that promotes translation of localized mRNAs', 'In investigating the nature of such a trans-synaptic signal , we uncovered a role for netrin-1/DCC signaling in local translation at synapses .

LTF induced by five applications of 5HT has also been shown to involve significant increases in the number of SN varicosities ( sites of synaptic connections ) in SN-MN cultures ( Glanzman , et al . , 1990 )', 'We thus measured the effect of netrin-1 on varicosity numbers , and , as shown in Figure 7H , found that it significantly increased the number of SN synaptic varicosities in SN-LFS MN cultures . Together , these findings suggest that the local translation induced by netrin-1 increases synaptic strength and synapse number', 'To explore the mechanisms by which netrin-1 regulates translation , we first asked whether it did so by binding to DCC .

We have previously identified hundreds of mRNAs in the neurites of Aplysia SNs ( Moccia et al . , 2003 ) , and studies of localized mRNAs in mammalian hippocampal neurons have indicated that hundreds ( Eberwine et al', ', 2002; Poon et al . , 2006 ) to thousands of transcripts ( Cajigas et al . , 2012 ) localize to dendrites . While some studies have indicated that a handful of these mRNAs localize to specific subcellular loci within the neuronal process , including sensorin mRNA , which localizes to synapses in Aplysia SNs ( Lyles et al', ', 2006 ) , and arc mRNA , which localizes to stimulated synapses in mammalian dentate granule neurons ( Steward et al . , 1998 ) , whether or not mRNAs undergo directed targeting from the soma to specific synapses , and whether or not RNA localization defines the fate of specific neuronal compartments , remains an open question', 'The Aplysia SN-MN culture system provides an ideal preparation for monitoring mRNA localization and local translation during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity , since a single neuron can be manipulated to form synapses or to undergo transcription- and translation-dependent synaptic strengthening in a branch-specific manner', 'Using this preparation , we find that the local proteome was regulated at the level of translation rather than by stimulus-induced mRNA targeting from the nucleus . Thus , transcripts , ribosomes , and translational machinery were delivered throughout the neuron , but translation was selectively activated in response to local stimuli such as synapse formation', 'We note that our studies do not rule out a role for more localized subcellular trafficking of mRNAs within neuronal processes , and/or selective stabilization within processes ( as described in Farris et al . ( 2014 ) ) , but they do indicate that synapse formation and synaptic stimulation do not regulate the trafficking from cell soma to process or synapse', 'Thus , transcripts that are induced by stimuli are delivered throughout the neuron , with their local distribution and translation being regulated by localized cues', 'We focused on a role for netrin-1 as the retrograde signal driving translation in the sensory neuron because it has been shown to promote translation in axonal growth cones ( Campbell and Holt , 2001 ) , to promote synaptogenesis in mammalian cortical neurons ( Goldman et al . , 2013 ) , and because Flanagan et al', 'have reported that the netrin receptor DCC serves as a transmembrane translation regulation complex in dendrites and axons ( Tcherkezian et al . , 2010 )', 'The finding that anti-DCC antibodies decrease sensorin immunoreactivity in SNs paired with MNs , but not in isolated SNs , is consistent with netrin-1 being released from the MN and binding to DCC on the adjacent pre-synaptic SN to promote the translation of sensorin at synapses', 'Netrin-1 binding to DCC may promote translation by releasing translational machinery from binding DCC cytoplasmic domains within the pre-synaptic terminal , as proposed by Flanagan et al .

Alternatively , netrin-1-induced translation may be downstream of PI3 kinase and/or MAPK pathways , both of which are activated by netrin-1 binding to DCC ( Li et al . , 2004; Round and Stein , 2007 )', 'We previously reported that serotonin-induced translation of sensorin in SNs required a calcium-dependent retrograde signal from the MN ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) .

We cloned Aplysia netrin-1 and found that it is 47% identical and 60% similar to human netrin-1 ( by comparison , C . elegans netrin-1 is 44% identical and 59% similar to human netrin-1 )', 'We also cloned Aplysia DCC and found that it is 31% identical and 47% similar to human DCC ( by comparison , C . elegans DCC is 18% identical and 31% similar to human DCC ) .

We suspect that netrin-1/DCC signaling is one of multiple local cues and signaling pathways that regulate translation in neurons and that translation is not regulated in a digital on/off manner , but rather in a graded manner', 'This explains , for example , why there is some sensorin translation in SN neurites contacting non-target L11 ( Figure 5 ) , and why sensorin protein is expressed in isolated sensory neurons that have been incubated with anti-DCC antibodies ( Figure 8A )', 'Our previously published report that synapse formation alters the localization of sensorin mRNA such that it concentrates at synapses ( Lyles et al . , 2006; Meer et al', ', 2012 ) , and that serotonin-regulated translation of a sensorin-based translational reporter was restricted to sites of synaptic contact , suggested that the activity-dependent synaptic localization of mRNA played a critical role in the regulation of its translation', 'Our current finding that netrin-1 increases translation at synaptic and non-synaptic sites indicates that the precise subcellular localization of the mRNA is secondary to the localization of the netrin-1 signal . Thus , sensorin mRNA does not have to be in the synaptic milieu per se to be translated but rather has to localize to a site in which netrin-1/DCC signaling can occur', 'We also note that we previously found that there was an increase in the concentration of sensorin mRNA in SN branches contacting target as compared to non-target MNs in more mature ( 5 DIV ) cocultures ( Lyles et al . , 2006 )', 'This suggests that while there is not directed targeting of sensorin mRNA from soma to process during synapse formation , there may be preferential stabilization , over time , of sensorin mRNA at sites of synaptic contact . This finding is consistent with recent studies indicating that regulated RNA degradation functions to localize mRNAs and to limit translation within axons ( Colak et al', ', 2013 ) . Our study also sheds light on the relative contributions of local translation and somatic translation to the local proteome . Thus , we can compare the amount of netrin-1-induced translation of the sensorin reporter in SN-LFS cocultures with and without the soma ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1D )', 'Although one cannot directly compare the total concentration of sensorin in intact SN and isolated SN neurites , our data indicate that netrin-1 is able to induce an equivalent increase in SN neurites in the presence or absence of a SN soma . This suggests that local translation contributes substantially to stimulus-induced changes in the local proteome', 'The fact that netrin-1 was able to stimulate global translation at non-synaptic sites as detected by phospho-eIF4E immunocytochemistry ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1C ) suggests that a large number of transcripts , and not just the two mRNAs we detected by FISH , localize throughout the neuronal arbor', 'Moreover , we found that every type of RNA that we imaged was delivered from the soma throughout the neuronal arbor , whether during synapse formation or following local stimulation . In contrast , we found that every measure of translation that we employed demonstrated localized translation at synapses and/or stimulated synapses', 'While our results are consistent with the idea that mRNAs are delivered throughout the neuronal arbor , validation of this idea as a general mechanism will require analysis of a larger pool of specific transcripts . Taken together , our findings show that a signaling pathway involved in axon guidance also regulates synapse formation by spatially restricting neuronal gene expression', 'Our findings further underscore an uncoupling of transcriptional and translational regulation in neurons , with stimuli triggering transcription of a population of mRNAs that are delivered throughout the neuron , but with local cues independently regulating their translation', 'Decentralizing the control of gene expression to individual subcellular compartments in this manner enriches the adaptability and plasticity of the nervous system by enabling each compartment to change its proteome in response to local cues', 'This mechanism allows all the branches of a neuron to be in a state of readiness to respond to local stimuli by changing their local proteome and hence their synaptic structure and function', 'Cultures were prepared from adult 80–100 gram Aplysia ( Alacrity , Redondo Beach , CA ) for SN-LFS MN cultures or from the abdominal ganglion of juvenile Aplysia ( 1–4 g , National Aplysia Resource , University of Miami , FL ) for L7 and L11 MNs .

The spontaneously active GABAergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata ( SNr ) , a major output of the basal ganglia , provide tonic inhibition of downstream brain areas', \"A depolarizing 'leak' current supports this firing pattern , but its molecular basis remains poorly understood . To understand how SNr neurons maintain tonic activity , we used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual mouse SNr neurons\", 'We discovered that SNr neurons express the sodium leak channel , NALCN , and that SNr neurons lacking NALCN have impaired spontaneous firing . In addition , NALCN is involved in the modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors', 'Our findings suggest that disruption of NALCN could impair the basal ganglia circuit , which may underlie the severe motor deficits in humans carrying mutations in NALCN . \\n Some neurons are capable of continuously firing action potentials in the complete absence of synaptic input ( Häusser et al . , 2004 )', 'This spontaneous activity is established by the intrinsic membrane properties that set the neuronal membrane potential and support repeated firing of action potentials ( Bean , 2007 )', 'Electrophysiological studies of spontaneously active neurons have frequently reported the presence of a tonic current that maintains these neurons at a more depolarized membrane potential and likely allows them to continuously fire action potentials ( Atherton and Bevan , 2005; Raman et al . , 2000; Jackson et al . , 2004; Taddese and Bean , 2002; Khaliq and Bean , 2010 )', \"This current , often referred to as a 'leak' or 'background' current , has characteristics of a nonselective cation current – it is sodium-dependent and has a reversal potential close to 0 mV . However , the molecular identity of the channel ( s ) that carry this leak current in many spontaneously firing neurons remains an open question\", 'In the substantia nigra pars reticulata ( SNr ) , GABAergic neurons fire spontaneously at relatively high firing rates , typically 30 spikes per second ( Sanderson et al . , 1986; Gulley et al . , 1999; Maurice et al . , 2003; Deransart et al . , 2003 )', 'This spontaneous firing is necessary for the tonic inhibition of downstream targets of the SNr and thus critical for the function of the basal ganglia ( Chevalier and Deniau , 1990; Hikosaka , 2007 )', 'SNr neurons have a leak current ( a sodium-dependent tonic current ) that maintains their membrane potential sufficiently depolarized to allow for spontaneous triggering of action potentials in the absence of any synaptic input ( Atherton and Bevan , 2005; Zhou and Lee , 2011 )', 'It has been suggested that a member of the Transient Receptor Potential ( TRP ) channel family , TRPC3 , is the basis for the tonic depolarizing current in SNr neurons ( Zhou et al . , 2008 ) . However , we previously found that the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons was unaffected by genetic deletion of TRPC3 , arguing against this possibility ( Lutas et al . , 2014 )', 'We also previously reported that the tonic depolarizing current in SNr neurons is decreased in response to metabolic inhibition , resulting in slowed firing ( Lutas et al . , 2014 ) . Here we report our efforts to identify the nonselective cation channel ( NSCC ) that supports the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons and determine the molecular identity of the glycolysis-sensitive NSCC', 'We used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the gene expression profile of SNr neurons and , specifically , the relative expression levels of NSCCs . We found that the sodium leak channel , NALCN ( Lu et al . , 2007 ) , was the highest expressed NSCC in SNr neurons', 'Electrophysiological experiments using pharmacological inhibitors supported a critical function of NALCN in maintaining firing , and conditional knockout of NALCN in SNr neurons impaired firing , confirming its importance', 'In addition , we found that the loss of NALCN significantly impaired modulation of SNr firing by glycolytic inhibition and by muscarinic metabotropic receptor activation , indicating that NALCN was involved in the regulation of SNr neuron excitability . Recent studies have reported that NALCN is expressed by other neurons in the brain ( Lu et al . , 2007; Flourakis et al . , 2015; Goldberg et al', ', 2012 ) , indicating that our findings in the SNr may be more broadly applicable . Furthermore , our results identify key cellular responses that are impaired in the absence of NALCN , and may have therapeutic value as human mutations in NALCN lead to severe motor and cognitive deficits ( Chong et al . , 2015; Aoyagi et al . , 2015; Al-Sayed et al . , 2013; Köroğlu et al . , 2013; Fukai et al', ', 2016 ) . \\n A tetrodotoxin-insensitive , tonic depolarizing current is necessary for spontaneous firing of SNr neurons , and this current has been attributed to constitutive activity of a NSCC ( Atherton and Bevan , 2005; Zhou et al . , 2008 ) . We previously found that inhibition of glycolysis in SNr neurons leads to a decrease in a tonic , depolarizing current and slows SNr firing ( Lutas et al', ', 2014 ) . We thus sought to identify the ion channel that carries this glycolysis-dependent tonic depolarizing current in SNr neurons . We initially used pharmacological tools that nonspecifically block multiple types of NSCCs . Flufenamic acid ( FFA; 100 μM ) , a commonly used NSCC blocker , rapidly decreased SNr firing ( Figure 1A , B )', 'The effect of FFA on SNr firing was dose dependent , and at higher concentrations , FFA could even silence SNr firing ( Kd = 4 . 7 × 10–510-5\\u2009M; Figure 1C ) .

Taken together , these results indicate that TRPC channels are not required to maintain the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons and are unlikely to provide the basis for the tonic depolarizing current', 'To clarify which NSSC are expressed by SNr neurons , we chose an unbiased approach that took advantage of advances in RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) technology to obtain whole transcriptome gene expression data from individual SNr neurons . This method required the isolation of GABAergic neurons that reside within the SNr from other cell types , especially the neighboring dopaminergic neurons', 'While currently there is no selective marker for SNr neurons , we could effectively isolate SNr neurons by a combination of anatomical localization and fluorescent marking of GABAergic neurons . We made acute coronal brain slices containing the SNr from brains of GAD1-EGFP transgenic mice , in which all GABAergic neurons are fluorescently labeled ( Figure 2A )', 'Then , we dissected out the SNr regions from brain slices , dissociated this tissue to isolate individual cells , and manually collected GFP-positive neurons with a micromanipulator while observing the cells in a fluorescent microscope ( Figure 2B )', 'We collected 87 GFP-positive SNr neurons , thus isolating GABAergic SNr neurons from neighboring dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and also separating them from dopamine neurons located within the SNr', 'To improve our ability to detect ion channel genes , which have comparatively low expression levels , we employed the SMART-seq2 method for preparing samples for RNA sequencing , which allows for reads to be made across the full sequence of gene transcripts ( Picelli et al . , 2014 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15271 . 004Figure 2 .

We first confirmed the selectivity of our SNr neuron RNA sequencing by examining cell-type marker genes ( Figure 2C ) . GFP-positive cells expressed general neuronal markers Map2 , Nefl , and Snap25', 'As expected , they also expressed GABAergic neuron markers Gad1 , Gad2 ( glutamic acid decarboxylases required for GABA synthesis ) and Slc32a1 ( the vesicular GABA transporter ) ( Figure 2C )', 'In contrast , these cells had little or no expression of dopaminergic neuron markers Th ( tyrosine hydroxylase required for the synthesis of a dopamine precursor ) , Ddc ( a decarboxylase required for dopamine synthesis ) , and Slc6a3 ( the dopamine transporter ) ( Figure 2C )', 'There was also little to no expression of glutamatergic neuronal markers Slc17a6 , Slc17a7 , and Slc17a8 ( vesicular glutamate transporters ) ( Figure 2C ) . We were therefore able to obtain whole transcriptome gene expression results from GABAergic SNr neurons , which guided our search for the NSCC that maintains the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons', 'To generate a candidate list of NSCCs in SNr neurons , we examined the expression of known NSCCs . In contrast to a previous study , we found that SNr neurons express several members of the TRP channel family in addition to TRPC3 ( Figure 3A ) . Interestingly , we found that NSCCs other than TRP channels were also expressed by SNr neurons', 'In particular , NALCN stood out as a promising candidate for the tonic depolarizing current , as it had the highest expression of all NSCCs ( Figure 3B ) and its expression was in the top 20% of all ion channels ( Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 )', 'In addition , we found that SNr neurons express Unc80 , Unc79 , and Fam155a , three genes whose protein products are known to interact with NALCN ( Xie et al . , 2013; Ren , 2011 ) ( Figure 3D ) .

At −60 mV , which is about the typical membrane potential during interspike intervals and the steady-state resting potential of SNr neurons when action potentials are blocked ( Lutas et al', ', 2014 ) , NALCN KO neurons had significantly less inward current compared to control SNr neurons ( Figure 5F ) . These data confirm that a decreased steady-state inward current mediates the slowing in firing rate observed for NALCN KO neurons .

The peak fold increase of WT , TRPC KO , and KO of all seven TRPC was not significantly different ( Figure 7F )', 'These results indicate that NALCN , but not TRPC3 , is important for the regulation of SNr neuron excitability by mAChR activation . While conditional knockout of NALCN significantly diminished the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons , SNr neurons were not completely silenced , indicating that other nonselective cation channels may contribute to maintaining spontaneous firing', 'Our RNA-seq results identified additional nonselective cation channel candidates , including channels that have not been previously investigated in the SNr . Although TRPML1 was the next highest expressed NSCCs candidate in our sequencing results ( Figure 3B ) , TRPML channels are not found in the plasma membrane and likely do not contribute to the membrane potential in neurons ( Cheng et al', ', 2010 ) . We also did not focus on HCN channels as it has been previously shown that inhibitors of HCN channels are without effect on SNr firing ( Atherton and Bevan , 2005 ) . We proceeded to test whether perturbing the function of other highly expressed NSCCs for which blockers or genetic tools were available could modify SNr firing', 'We first tested whether TRPM7 , which is known to function as a channel in the plasma membrane ( Bates-Withers et al . , 2011 ) , was involved in maintaining spontaneous firing by conditionally ablating TRPM7 in SNr neurons . We used a transgenic Trpm7fl/fl mouse line ( Jin et al . , 2008 ) to virally transduce neurons with the hSyn-EGFP-cre vector', 'We found that knockout of TRPM7 was without effect on SNr firing ( Figure 8A ) , arguing against a role of TRMP7 in the spontaneous activity of SNr neurons . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15271 . 012Figure 8 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15271', '012 We next tested the involvement of TRPM2 , another NSCC we found to be expressed by SNr neurons . Previous studies have shown that TRPM2 is activated by NMDA receptors or by hydrogen peroxide leading to elevated firing of SNr neurons ( Lee et al . , 2013 )', 'However , no evidence of constitutively open TRPM2 channels has been reported in the SNr , making it unlikely that this channel supports the spontaneous firing . We found that rather than decreasing SNr firing rate , a blocker of TRPM2 , clotrimazole ( Hill et al . , 2004 ) , produced a significant but very small increase in firing rate ( Figure 8B )', 'These results do not support a substantial role for TRPM2 in baseline firing . Lastly , we tested whether pannexin channels ( PANX1 and PANX2 ) are involved in the basal firing rate of SNr neurons . These channels are inhibited by carbenoxolone ( CBX ) , but this drug can block other ion channels as well ( Connors , 2012 )', 'Inhibition by CBX at relatively lower concentrations can be indicative of a role of pannexin channels ( Ma et al . , 2009; Bruzzone et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , we tested several concentrations of CBX on SNr spontaneous firing and found a dose-dependent inhibition of firing ( Figure 8C ) . However , the observed IC50 was much\\xa0higher ( Kd = 1', '5 × 10–4\\u2009M ) than expected for a pannexin-dependent effect ( Kd = 5 × 10–6\\u2009M ) , arguing against an important role of pannexin channels . Overall , these results suggest that NALCN is the main NSCC that contributes to spontaneous firing of SNr neurons , while the other highly expressed NSCCs are not critically involved in spontaneous firing', 'Many neuron types display pronounced , intrinsically-regulated spontaneous firing patterns that are crucial for normal circuit function ( Häusser et al . , 2004; Bean , 2007 ) . However , the molecular machinery that sustains this firing is not fully understood ( Häusser et al . , 2004; Ren , 2011 )', '“Leak current” has long been a catch-all term to describe the depolarizing current that is one component of spontaneous firing ( Atherton and Bevan , 2005; Raman et al . , 2000; Jackson et al . , 2004; Taddese and Bean , 2002; Khaliq and Bean , 2010 )', 'Spontaneously firing GABAergic SNr neurons provide a key source of inhibitory tone to target areas including the superior colliculus and pedunculopontine nucleus ( Hikosaka , 2007 ) . In SNr neurons , a sodium-dependent , TTX-insensitive depolarizing current has been attributed to a NSCC , but the molecular identity of this current remains undefined ( Atherton and Bevan , 2005 )', 'Identifying the molecular basis of this current is important to enable detailed investigation of how its properties and regulation underlie SNr tonic inhibition of basal ganglia targets . In order to address this , we performed whole transcriptome sequencing of SNr neurons and detected expression of several NSCCs that could potentially generate the tonic depolarizing current', 'We discovered that SNr neurons express NALCN , which stood out as a prime candidate for the channel carrying the depolarizing leak current in these cells', 'Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic techniques , we showed that: 1 ) NALCN is functionally active in SNr neurons; 2 ) NALCN is an important component of the machinery that maintains spontaneous firing in SNr neurons , 3 ) NALCN is required for sensitivity of SNr neuron firing to glycolysis , and 4 ) NALCN is important for muscarinic receptor-dependent stimulation of SNr neuron firing', 'Taken together , our findings support a critical role of NALCN in both maintenance of spontaneous firing of SNr neurons and physiological modulation of SNr neuron excitability . NALCN is highly conserved evolutionarily . In the invertebrate species D . melanogaster , C . elegans , and L', 'stagnalis , their respective NALCN homologs are critical for pacemaker neuron function in circadian rhythms ( Nash et al . , 2002; Lear et al . , 2005 ) , locomotion ( Yeh et al . , 2008; Gao et al . , 2015 ) , and respiration ( Lu and Feng , 2011 )', 'In mice , germ-line ablation of NALCN produces animals that develop normally , but die soon after birth from impairment in the rhythmically active neurons that regulate respiration ( Lu et al . , 2007 ) . Hippocampal neurons cultured from NALCN KO mice show significantly hyperpolarized membrane potentials indicating an important function of NALCN in maintaining depolarized membrane potentials', 'A recent study employing conditional knockout of NALCN in forebrain excitatory neurons demonstrated that NALCN is necessary for appropriate excitability of neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and underlies circadian rhythms in flies and rodents ( Flourakis et al . , 2015 )', 'In addition , this study reported that the forebrain NALCN knockout mice died ~21 days after birth , further indicating the critical function of this channel . Our results demonstrate that NALCN is necessary for normal spontaneous firing of SNr neurons and for the regulation of SNr excitability', 'The combined results of these studies are consistent with the idea that NALCN is a critical component of neuronal excitability in many rhythmically active neurons ( Ren , 2011 ) . NALCN also appears to mediate several modulatory influences on SNr firing', 'We find that it is important for regulation of SNr neuronal excitability in response to changes in glycolysis , an effect we had seen previously when investigating metabolic influences on SNr firing rate ( Lutas et al . , 2014 )', 'Together with our finding that the increased firing produced by muscarinic receptor activation is blunted in NALCN KO SNr neurons , these results suggest that tuning the level of NALCN activity may set both the tonic and phasic excitability of SNr neurons', 'Interestingly , NALCN has also been found in insulin-releasing pancreatic beta cells , and muscarinic receptor activation can increase NALCN activity in these cells ( Swayne et al . , 2009 ) . Our finding that NALCN activity decreases when we block glycolysis in SNr neuron may also occur in beta cells', 'In beta cells , a decrease in NALCN activity along with an increase in ATP-sensitive potassium channel activity when glucose levels are low would work together to hyperpolarize beta cells and prevent insulin release . Therefore , the metabolic sensitivity of NALCN may be a broadly used modality to confer metabolic sensitivity to NALCN-expressing cells', 'One question that arises from our results is how the activity of NALCN is decreased by the inhibition of glycolysis . A possible insight comes from the finding that metabotropic receptor signaling can modulate the activity of NALCN in neurons ( Lu et al . , 2009 ) and pancreatic beta cells ( Swayne et al . , 2009 )', 'Interestingly , this metabotropic receptor signaling does not modulate NALCN via canonical G-protein coupled signaling; rather , channel activity is regulated by phosphorylation of the channel by Src kinases ( Ren , 2011 ) . Phosphorylation of NALCN may be the major regulator of NALCN activity , either activating or inhibiting channel activity', 'During inhibition of glycolysis , the drop in cytosolic [ATP] and increase in [AMP] activates AMP kinase ( AMPK ) ( Kahn et al . , 2005 ) , which may directly phosphorylate NALCN at a site that leads to decreased NALCN activity', 'An example of this possibility is the ion channel Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ( CFTR ) , which is activated by Src kinases phosphorylation ( Billet et al . , 2015 ) , but inhibited by AMPK phosphorylation ( Hallows et al . , 2000; Kongsuphol et al . , 2009 )', 'Alternatively , there may be crosstalk between AMPK and the ability of Src family kinases to activate NALCN ( such crosstalk is seen in regulation of metabolism by the Src family kinase Fyn and AMPK ( Bastie et al . , 2007 ) ) . An exciting direction for future studies will be to better understand how intracellular signaling pathways regulate NALCN activity in neurons', 'Our findings may also have clinical relevance , as mutations in NALCN have been implicated in several human disorders ( Cochet-Bissuel et al . , 2014 ) . Recent studies have found that mutations in NALCN result in severe motor and cognitive deficits in humans ( Chong et al . , 2015; Aoyagi et al . , 2015; Al-Sayed et al . , 2013; Köroğlu et al . , 2013; Fukai et al . , 2016 )', 'In addition , humans carrying mutations in UNC80 , a protein that is important for the function of NALCN ( Ren , 2011 ) , show severe deficits that mirror those observed in humans with mutations in NALCN ( Perez et al . , 2015; Shamseldin et al . , 2016; Stray-Pedersen et al . , 2016 )', 'The SNr is a main output of the basal ganglia motor circuit and provides tonic inhibition of target areas ( Hikosaka , 2007 ) . Our finding that SNr neurons require NALCN for appropriate tonic firing , suggests that NALCN mutations could contribute to basal ganglia related motor disorders', 'For example , disruption of the normal tonic firing of SNr neurons by injection of GABA receptor agonists , leads to excessive muscle tension and dystonia ( Burbaud et al . , 1998 ) . In addition , hyperactivity of the SNr is observed in Parkinsonian animals ( Wichmann et al . , 1999 ) and ablation of the SNr can ameliorate symptoms of Parkinson’s diseases ( Wichmann et al . , 2001 )', 'Therefore , understanding the function of NALCN in modulating the tonic activity of SNr neurons may lead to a more detailed mechanistic understanding of motor dysfunction in humans and potentially provide a new therapeutic target for motor disorders', 'While NALCN is a major contributor to the spontaneous firing rate of SNr neurons , elimination of NALCN resulted in only a halving in the firing rates of SNr neurons . This observation is in contrast to the effects of Gd3+ , which completely silenced firing of WT SNr neurons; this suggests that other Gd3+-sensitive currents , in addition to NALCN , may drive the firing of SNr neurons', 'We tested the possibility that other NSCCs that we found to be expressed in SNr neurons ( TRPM7 , TRPM2 , and pannexin ) may contribute to the firing rate; however , we found that TRPM7 knock-out or pharmacological inhibition of TRPM2 or pannexin were without effect on the firing rate of SNr neurons', 'Therefore , we were unable to identify NSCCs , other than NALCN , that are critical for spontaneous firing . One interesting possibility to explain the continued firing in the NALCN KO is that the expression of inward-current-carrying leak channels may be balanced homeostatically with outward-current-carrying leak potassium channels', 'In that case , loss of NALCN would lead to decreased expression of leak potassium channels and therefore offset the decreased inward current , allowing spontaneous firing to persist . While this idea is attractive , we did not find direct evidence of this possibility', 'In our single-cell gene expression dataset , there was no significant correlation between the expression of NALCN and the two highest expressed leak potassium channels , KCNK1 and KCNK3 . Additionally , the results of our steady-state I-V recordings were inconsistent with a decrease in leak potassium current', 'If outward leak currents were decreasing along with inward leak currents , we would expect to observe a significant increase in the membrane resistance of SNr neurons lacking NALCN , but we did not . It remains possible that changes in the expression of other ion channels may compensate for the loss of NALCN in the knockout , as spontaneous firing is a critical function of the SNr', 'The Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals approved all procedures involving animals .

This phase diagram shows that cells with high membrane tension are especially sensitive to changes in Arp2/3 complex nucleation rate ( Kaplan et al', ', in preparation ) , whereas cells with low membrane tension carry out endocytosis even with low Arp2/3 complex activity , consistent with experimental observations ( Boulant et al . , 2011 )', 'We hypothesized that actin network self-organization arising from the broad Hip1R distribution around the pit ( Figure 4 ) and filament bending ( Figure 5 ) might allow for the endocytic actin network to change its organization and force-producing capacity under elevated loads ( Figure 7 )', 'To test this hypothesis , we conducted simulations in which Hip1R coverage was varied for different values of plasma membrane tension ( Figure 8A and Figure 7—video 1 ) . We found that the endocytic actin network’s ability to adapt to load ( Figure 7 ) depends on Hip1R coverage around the pit ( Figure 8D–F )', 'As the coverage of Hip1R around the pit increased , actin’s ability to adapt to changes in membrane tension also increased , as measured by the number of barbed ends near the base of the pit ( Figure 8D ) , the binding of active Arp2/3 complex at the base of the pit ( Figure 8E ) , subsequent nucleation of additional actin filaments ( Figure 8F ) , and bending of actin filaments near the base of the pit ( Figure 8G )', 'We conclude that sufficient Hip1R coverage around the pit ( Clarke and Royle , 2018; Sochacki et al . , 2017 ) allows endocytic actin filaments to orient in such a way that they can encounter more Arp2/3 complexes at the base of the pit to nucleate more actin filaments', 'This spatial organization allows the actin network to adapt to sustain force production under a range of opposing loads ( Figure 8H ) . \\n Understanding the relationship between actin filament assembly , actin network organization , and force generation on the plasma membrane requires iterative feedback between experimental measurements and computational modeling', 'An ultimate goal of this study was to relate single actin filament mechanics to force generation by the collective actin filament network in CME ( Lacayo et al . , 2007 )', 'We integrated modeling and quantitative cellular measurements to show that a minimal actin network composed of actin , the Arp2/3 complex and capping protein , with linker attachments in the clathrin coat and rates constrained by cellular and biochemical measurements , is able to generate sufficient force to internalize endocytic pits against mammalian plasma membrane tension', 'Approximately 200 Arp2/3 complexes constitutively assemble at sites of endocytosis in human induced pluripotent stem cells . Endocytic actin filaments self-organize into a radial dendritic array , in which filaments grow toward the base of the pit . These filaments bend and store elastic energy , which supports internalization', 'The endocytic actin network adapts to changes in membrane tension by driving more filaments to the base of the pit and increasing filament bending , which supports a higher load and nucleates more actin filaments . Four lines of experimental evidence support our model ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 )', 'Two pieces of evidence serve as model validation based on published data and two more are based on experiments conducted in this study . Previous experiments from our lab showed that knocking down Hip1R in HeLa cells inhibited endocytosis ( Engqvist-Goldstein et al . , 2004 )', 'Consistent with these observations , our simulations showed that a threshold number of actin linkers such as Hip1R is necessary for endocytic internalization ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3A and\\xa0Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–B ) . This threshold appears necessary to allow efficient filament capture by the coat and force transmission from the actin network to the coat', 'Second , experiments showed that capping actin filament elongation with the small molecule compound Cytochalasin inhibits CME , reflected by an increase in stalled endocytic sites marked by clathrin-RFP ( Brady et al . , 2010 ) or slower accumulation of dynamin2-GFP at endocytic sites ( Grassart et al . , 2014 )', 'We also showed in our model that capping rate is an important parameter for progression of CME; our simulations show that increasing\\xa0the capping rate of actin filaments inhibits CME , presumably because increasing capping decreases the total amount of actin ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and Figure 8—figure supplement 1C–D )', 'In this study , our simulations predicted that actin filaments bend around endocytic pits .

Without sufficient Arp2/3 complex , CME fails due to insufficient force production', 'Three main conclusions resulted from our study . First , we found that the spatial segregation of Arp2/3 complex activation and Hip1R linker proteins on the clathrin coat are important factors for effective force generation', 'Unlike actin organization at the leading edge of a migrating cell wherein only one boundary condition at the plasma membrane is sufficient to enable force-generation capacity to be inferred ( Abercrombie , 1980; Bieling et al', ', 2016; Mogilner and Edelstein-Keshet , 2002 ) , in CME two boundary conditions are required -- one at the base of the pit for actin polymerization against the plasma membrane and the second on the coat of the pit for attachment of the growing actin filaments so forces are transmitted to the pit to drive internalization', 'In our model , we used Hip1R as a surrogate for Hip1 , Hip1R , and Epsin1/2/3 , which cooperatively link actin filaments to the coat ( Brett et al . , 2006; Chen et al . , 1998; Messa et al . , 2014; Senetar et al . , 2004; Skruzny et al . , 2012 )', 'We conclude that based on the relative positions of Arp2/3 complex activators and actin filament linkers , the resultant self-organized actin network orients to produce force orthogonal to the base of the pit rather than producing a pinching force on the neck ( Collins et al . , 2011; Hassinger et al . , 2017 )', 'Pinching forces are achieved by the spontaneous curvature of the rigid coat ( Alimohamadi et al . , 2018; Foret , 2014; Hassinger et al . , 2017 )', 'Any constriction forces generated by actin polymerization at the neck would likely occur at a later stage of endocytosis than is the focus of our model , and the filaments would need to be nucleated by a spatially distinct set of Arp2/3 activating proteins around the neck , or by an interaction between other actin filaments and dynamin , but the mechanism for arranging and anchoring such a network has not been elucidated ( Ma and Berro , 2018 )', 'Second , the effective anchoring of actin filaments to the surface of the pit depends on the distribution of linker proteins on the pit surface . Since these linker proteins are embedded within the clathrin coat ( Clarke and Royle , 2018; Engqvist-Goldstein et al . , 2001; Sochacki et al . , 2017 ) , their surface coverage is directly proportional to the coat coverage on the endocytic pit', 'This observation suggests that one possible function of a large coat is for the actin-linking proteins Hip1 , Hip1R and Epsin to cover enough surface area to provide leverage for internalization', 'The role of linker protein coverage in force generation also has implications for the flat-to-curved transition earlier in endocytosis , when the membrane either begins to bend from a flat pre-assembled coat or continually deforms while the coat assembles ( Avinoam et al . , 2015; Bucher et al . , 2018; Scott et al . , 2018; Sochacki and Taraska , 2019 )', 'In cases when the clathrin coat gradually increases in area during membrane deformation , our findings imply that actin polymerization may be ineffective until the coat reaches a threshold size ( Avinoam et al . , 2015; Sun et al . , 2017 ) , with membrane tension controlling a switch for the flat-to-curved transition ( Bucher et al . , 2018; Scott et al . , 2018 )', 'Future work will investigate the relationship between coat topology and actin forces during the initiation of endocytosis . Third , we showed a significant fraction of endocytic actin filaments bend under force . We predict that the bent filaments , whose existence we confirmed by cryo-electron tomography of intact cells , contribute to successful endocytic internalization in at least two ways', 'First , they might contribute to the resilience of endocytosis by preventing backsliding of the pit', 'Second , we expect that they contribute to internalization by releasing stored elastic energy when they straighten out under thermal fluctuations , consistent with the elastic Brownian ratchet mechanism for actin-mediated force production ( De La Cruz and Gardel , 2015a; Mogilner and Oster , 1996 )', 'Here , filament bending occurs to a greater extent and for a longer time than previously described for coherent flat surfaces like the leading edge , possibly due to the curved geometry of endocytic pits . Fixing the filament orientation at one end increases bending energy ( De La Cruz et al . , 2015b; Fernández et al . , 2006 ) , which is accomplished here by multivalent attachments from Hip1R', 'Previous studies overlooked the role of actin filament bending at endocytic sites because of the predicted short length of filaments based on population averages ( Berro et al . , 2010 ) and the possible loss of less densely branched filaments during the preparation process for platinum-replica electron microscopy ( detergent extraction or sonication-based unroofing ) ( Collins et al . , 2011 )', 'The load response of branched actin networks in vitro can be reversible due to filament bending ( Chaudhuri et al . , 2007 ) , or permanent from a change in filament architecture ( Bieling et al . , 2016; Parekh et al . , 2005 )', 'In our simulations , some of the elastic energy from bent filaments is released as internalization increases , suggesting a reversible compression of the network to store elastic energy ( Figure 5 ) . However , a significant fraction of filament bending is retained after the spring is released , which suggests that load also changes the intrinsic structure of the network ( Bieling et al . , 2016 )', 'Importantly , the results presented here demonstrate a mechanism of active adaptation by the endocytic actin network to changes in load ( Figure 7 ) . Different cell types , different locations in the same cell , and different stages of endocytosis at the same location can have different membrane tension values at different times ( Shi et al . , 2018 )', 'Under flat geometries , branched actin networks adapt to load ( Bieling et al . , 2016; Mueller et al . , 2017 ) . Here , the distribution of Hip1R linkers around the pit directs more filaments to grow toward the base of the pit ( Figure 4 ) , which nucleates more filaments autocatalytically and increases filament bending ( Figure 5 ) , thereby supporting greater internalization ( Figure 7 )', 'It is now important to determine whether the principles of actin filament self-organization and load adaptation identified here also apply to endocytic actin in the higher force regime characteristic of fungi . An agent-based model of endocytic actin networks in yeast predicted that barbed filament ends radiate away from the center of pit in the XY plane ( Mund et al . , 2018 )', 'However , the\\xa0>200 x larger force requirements in this organism lead to a different axial organization of the filaments , less filament bending , and a distinct mechanism of force production sufficient to counteract high turgor pressure', 'Understanding the mechanical function and load adaptation in the ‘soft’ regime studied here is likely to apply to a variety of cellular membrane bending processes employing branched actin networks , including the assembly and maturation of endosomes , lysosomes , and autophagosomes ( Rottner et al . , 2017 )', 'Finally , we acknowledge that our model represents a minimal core actin machinery necessary for endocytic internalization in mammalian cells . This feature of our study was necessary so the number of free parameters could be limited . Future models will add complexity to test roles for filament crosslinking , filament severing , and myosin-I motor activity , among other factors', 'It is anticipated that these additional features will increase our understanding of the force-generation capability and overall efficiency of the endocytic actin network . \\n We combined a continuum membrane mechanics model with filament-based simulations of actin polymerization coupled to endocytic pit internalization to develop a multiscale model of actin in mammalian endocytosis', 'In the continuum model , the bending of the membrane was explicitly modeled and the contributions of the actin cytoskeleton were simplified to an applied localized force , while the agent-based model simplified the membrane and explicitly modeled actin and associated binding proteins ( Scheme 1 ) . We iteratively ran simulations in each module', 'The results from each module improved the assumptions of the other , over successive rounds of simulation and comparison to experimental measurements . In particular , experiments focused our attention on the internalization of the U-shaped pit and its transition to omega shape for both the membrane and actin modules', 'Experiments and the actin module informed the location of actin forces for the membrane mechanics model . The membrane mechanics simulations in turn informed the initial pit shape and force/extension relationship for the actin module', 'Thus , these two modules synergistically provided collective information about how actin organization and dynamics couple to the bending and internalization of the clathrin-coated pit .

However , a link between epsin and Hip1R in metazoan cells has not been reported', 'Hip1 family members ( Hip1 and Hip1R in mammals ) comprise an N-terminal ANTH domain followed by unfolded regions that bracket a coiled-coil region and a C-terminal THATCH ( talin-HIP1/R/Sla2p actin-tethering C-terminal homology ) domain ( Engqvist-Goldstein et al . , 1999; Wilbur et al . , 2008; Skruzny et al . , 2012 )', 'The coiled-coil region can homo-heterodimerize and also binds clathrin light chain ( Engqvist-Goldstein et al . , 2001; Metzler et al . , 2001; Legendre-Guillemin et al . , 2002; Gottfried et al . , 2010 ) . The THATCH domain is an actin-binding module ( Yang et al . , 1999; Engqvist-Goldstein et al . , 2001; Brett et al . , 2006; Wilbur et al . , 2008 )', 'Accordingly , Sla2/Hip1R binds actin and is thought to function as a major link between the clathrin coat and actin . Studies in yeast have additionally shown that the ENTH domain of epsin and the ANTH domain of Sla2 interact with each other , and the two proteins function together in providing a link between the endocytic coat and the actin cytoskeleton ( Skruzny et al . , 2012 )', 'In addition to roles of epsin mediated by protein–protein interactions , membrane remodeling properties resulting from the amphipathic helix at the N-terminus of its ENTH domain have been implicated in the clathrin-dependent endocytic reaction', 'In vitro studies showed that this helix confers , upon the ENTH domain , the property to induce bilayer curvature and even to fragment bilayer tubules into vesicles , thus pointing to a potential role of the epsin in fission ( Itoh et al . , 2001; Ford et al . , 2002; Boucrot et al . , 2012 )', 'Surprisingly , in view of this evidence for an important housekeeping role of epsin in endocytosis , the germline knockout ( KO ) of the mouse Epn1 and Epn2 genes that encode the two major ubiquitously expressed mammalian epsins , epsin 1 and 2 , did not block the early embryonic development ( Chen et al . , 2009 ) . Arrest of embryonic development occurred only at E9', '5–E10 , with a pattern suggestive of impaired Notch signaling , while no obvious defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis were observed in fibroblasts derived from these embryos ( Chen et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , studies of epsin 1 and 2 conditional double KO endothelial cells revealed a selective defect in the internalization of ubiquitinated VEGF receptor ( Pasula et al . , 2012 )', 'However , a recent study based on RNAi-mediated knock-down ( KD ) in fibroblastic cells reported that the KD of all the three epsins produces a global impairment of clathrin-mediated endocytosis , which was attributed to a defect of the fission reaction ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 )', 'The goal of the present study was to provide conclusive evidence about the function ( s ) and sites of action of epsin in endocytosis using a gene KO strategy to completely eliminate all epsins', 'Our results , which capitalize on triple KO ( TKO ) cells generated from conditional epsin TKO mice , show that epsin provides a link between the clathrin coat and actin and is needed for the transition of pits from a shallow to a deeply invaginated state . As in unicellular organisms , epsin acts in concert with Hip1R but with differences from yeast to mammals', 'An additional function of epsin is a low affinity interaction of its ENTH domain with synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2 ( Syb2 ) that may help ensure the presence of a vesicular SNARE in the budding vesicle . \\n As the germline deletion of even only two Epn genes results in embryonic lethality , a conditional approach was used to generate Epn1 , Epn2 , and Epn3 triple KO cells', 'Towards this goal , Epn1loxP/loxP ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A , see also [Pasula et al . , 2012] ) mice were crossed with Epn2 ( Chen et al . , 2009 ) and Epn3 KO ( Ko et al . , 2010 ) mice to generate Epn1loxP/loxP; Epn2−/−; Epn3−/− animals , which were viable and fertile with no obvious pathological phenotypes', 'These mice were subsequently interbred with mice transgenic for 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen ( OHT ) -inducible Cre recombinase [Cre-ER , Badea et al . , 2003] to obtain Epn1loxP/loxP; Epn2−/−; Epn3−/−; Cre-ER+/0 animals . These mice did not exhibit obvious defects either', 'Conditional epsin TKO mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were derived from these animals via treatment with OHT , whose action was confirmed by the translocation of Cre into the nucleus ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) , and typically examined after 7 days of OHT treatment ( after 9 days of treatment cell death started to occur )', 'Treated MEFs derived from the same litters but harboring a wild-type ( WT ) epsin 1 allele did not exhibit any obvious differences from OHT-treated WT fibroblasts in terms of proliferation , endocytosis and actin organization . In the experiments described below OHT-treated WT MEFs were used as controls', 'Immunoblotting with epsin isoform-specific antibodies demonstrated the near complete disappearance of epsin 1 from conditional TKO cell extracts in response to OHT ( Figure 1A ) and confirmed the absence of epsin 2 and 3 ( Figure 1B )', 'The extremely small amount of residual epsin 1 was likely explained by delayed gene recombination in a few cells , where residual epsin 1 immunoreactivity , much lower than in controls , was observed by immunofluorescence', 'A C-terminal epsin 2 fragment ( MW about 40 kDa ) was detected in cells containing the epsin 2 KO allele , possibly reflecting an alternative start site ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) .

However , important differences relative to incubations with control cytosol were observed', 'In membrane sheets incubated with control brain cytosol , F-actin polymerized in alignment with the invaginations thus generating a well-organized scaffold that contributes to maintain their parallel orientation perpendicular to the plasma membrane ( Figure 5B , left panels )', 'On the contrary , in membranes incubated with TKO cytosol , the F-actin network around the invaginations was exaggerated and disorganized ( Figure 5B , right panels ) , leading to clumping of the tips of the invaginations in a meshwork of actin . As a result of this clumping , invaginations often had an oblique orientation ( Figure 5A , B , right panels and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B )', 'Such disorganization was confirmed by electron microscopic observations of sections cut parallel to the substrate . Regularly spaced cross-sectioned tubules interspersed within an actin meshwork were observed with WT cytosol , but numerous obliquely cut tubules embedded in a dense actin matrix were visible with TKO cytosol ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C , D )', 'Another striking modification related to an abnormal actin cytoskeleton was the mislocalization of myosin 1E . As shown by immunofluorescence , this protein was localized at the bottom of the tubular invaginations in sheets incubated with WT cytosol , but at the tips in sheets incubated with epsin TKO brain cytosol ( Figure 5C and higher magnifications )', 'The differences in the cell-free assay using WT vs TKO cytosol were consistent with abnormal actin nucleation observed at clathrin-coated pits of intact TKO cells', 'Furthermore , in agreement with these observations , Hip1R immunoreactivity was present at the tips of the invaginations in sheet preparations incubated with WT cytosol , but was largely absent from the tubules incubated with TKO cytosol ( Figure 5D )', 'This was in spite of the higher levels of Hip1R in the TKO brain cytosol ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1E ) in agreement with the higher levels of Hip1R in TKO fibroblasts ( Figure 4A ) . Thus , also in this system , Hip1R recruitment requires epsin . We also prepared cytosol from brains of mice lacking Hip1R and its close homologue Hip1 ( Hip1/Hip1R double KO ( DKO ) mice [Bradley et al', ', 2007] ) . These mice are typically dwarfed , afflicted with severe spinal defects , and die in early adulthood ( Bradley et al . , 2007 ) . When membrane sheets were incubated with Hip1/Hip1R DKO brain cytosol , differences from WT were observed that were qualitatively similar to those obtained with the epsin TKO cytosol , but quantitatively milder ( Figure 5E , F )', 'Tubular invaginations were longer and some exaggerated and disorganized actin was also observed ( Figure 5E , F ) . Importantly , localization of epsin 1 at the tips of the invaginations was not affected by the absence of Hip1/Hip1R in the cytosol ( Figure 5G ) , once again as in the case of intact cells', 'Altogether , the results discussed above support a role for epsin as a critical factor required for the temporal and spatial coordination between clathrin-mediated endocytosis and actin dynamics . We thus explored whether epsin interacts directly with actin by incubating recombinant epsin 1 fragments ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1F ) with purified F-actin followed by co-sedimentation', 'This analysis revealed that both the DPW and NPF motif containing regions of the protein ( Chen et al . , 1998 ) , but not the ENTH domain , bind actin ( Figure 5H ) . Thus , there appear to be at least two actin-binding sites in epsin', 'The site in the NPF motif containing region likely corresponds to the actin cytoskeleton-binding ( ACB ) site , previously identified in yeast epsin ( Ent1 , Skruzny et al . , 2012 )', 'Collectively , previous findings from the literature and the findings described above are consistent with roles for epsin from early to late stage clathrin-coated pits , and more generally for an essential role of this protein in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammalian fibroblasts', 'It was therefore of interest to determine whether epsin , like several clathrin adaptors with ENTH/ANTH domains ( Hirst et al . , 2004; Miller et al . , 2007 , 2011; Koo et al . , 2011 ) , binds SNAREs . SNARE binding by ENTH/ANTH family proteins helps coordinate bud formation with the incorporation of an appropriate SNARE in the nascent vesicle to direct its fate after fission', 'Such binding in the case of epsin would likely be of very low affinity , as it was not detected in previous investigations . However , even a low affinity binding could be of physiological significance in the context of other synergistic interaction between epsin , the membrane bilayer and other coat proteins', 'Pull-downs from mouse brain lysate using GST–ENTH domain of epsin 1 as bait , followed by analysis of the affinity purified material by mass spectroscopy , identified Syb2 as one of the top hits ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A )', 'A direct interaction was next explored by assessing binding to the ENTH domain of epsin 1 ( with an His tag at the C-terminus ) to increasing concentrations of the cytosolic portion of Syb2 fused to GST ( Figure 6A ) . The very low affinity of this interaction ( KD 470 ± 30 μM ) was enhanced by the presence in the incubation medium of IP6 ( KD 80 ± 7', '9 μM , Figure 6B , D and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B ) , which induces the folding of helix zero of the ENTH domain ( Itoh et al . , 2001; Ford et al . , 2002 ) . In contrast , the deletion of helix zero from the ENTH construct abolished Syb2 binding in either the presence or the absence of IP6 ( Figure 6C )', 'Further analysis of the interaction of Syb2 with the ENTH domain using Syb2 fragments ( Figure 6E ) identified the SNARE motif of Syb2 ( Figure 6F , G ) , and more specifically the N-terminal portion of the motif ( residues 29–60 , Figure 6H , I ) , as the region responsible for binding', 'Interestingly , previously reported interactions of vesicular SNAREs with ENTH/ANTH proteins also involve their SNARE motifs ( Koo et al . , 2011; Miller et al . , 2011 ) , pointing to an interaction mutually exclusive with SNARE complex formation , as expected for an ‘endocytic’ interaction . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03311 . 011Figure 6 .

The low affinity interaction of epsin with an exocytic SNARE is evolutionarily conserved as yeast Snc1 ( a Syb2 homologue ) bound the ENTH domain of Ent1 in a recombinant pull-down assay ( Figure 6J )', 'Previous reports have addressed the role of epsin in endocytosis . However , studies in different organisms and in cell-free systems had emphasized the different aspects of its function , so that a complete picture of its physiological role ( s ) has remained elusive', 'Elucidation of epsin function in mammalian cells had been complicated by the existence of the three Epn genes with overlapping functions . To overcome this problem , we have generated cells that lack all the three epsins by a conditional KO approach involving the OHT-dependent disruption of the Epn1 gene in epsin 2 and 3 double KO mice', 'A main conclusion of our study is the occurrence of a close coupling between the function of epsin and the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton . While such coupling had been suggested by studies in unicellular organisms , studies of epsin in cells of metazoan had emphasized its role as a bilayer deforming protein ( Ford et al . , 2002; Boucrot et al', ', 2012 ) and as a cargo-specific adaptor ( Polo et al . , 2002; Overstreet et al . , 2003; Chen and De Camilli , 2005; Meloty-Kapella et al . , 2012 ) . A link of epsin to actin function at endocytic clathrin-coated pits , and in particular a role as a factor that ensures a ‘controlled’ actin growth at sites of endocytosis , is supported by several observations', 'First , Hip1R , which had so far been considered the major link of endocytic clathrin coats to actin in mammalian cells ( Engqvist-Goldstein et al . , 2001; Le Clainche et al . , 2007 ) , is not recruited to endocytic clathrin-coated pits in the absence of epsin', 'This is consistent with the interaction and functional partnership of epsin with Sla2/Hip1R , previously demonstrated in yeast and Dictyostelium , although in yeast it is Sla2 that recruits epsin to clathrin-coated pits ( Skruzny et al . , 2012 )', 'Second , the lack of epsin results in a disruption of the normal actin cytoskeleton with a major loss of stress fibers and an accumulation of actin foci at the cell surface , typically in proximity of arrested endocytic clathrin-coated pits . Third , epsin binds actin directly via its disordered tail region', 'Fourth , a cell-free assay of endocytosis involving plasma membrane sheets and brain cytosol revealed that relative to WT , epsin-deficient cytosol results in an exaggerated and abnormal growth of the actin cytoskeleton', 'These findings suggest a role for epsin in orchestrating a coupling between actin and endocytic clathrin coats that ( 1 ) limits excessive actin growth and ( 2 ) helps mediate an effect of actin polymerization on bud invagination', 'A functional partnership between epsin and Hip1R explains why the KD of Hip1R results in a similar enhanced and abnormal actin nucleation at endocytic sites , with the formation of large actin bundles projecting away from these sites ( Engqvist-Goldstein et al . , 2004 )', 'The excess of actin nucleation in the absence of epsin is of special interest as in yeast the ENTH domains of Ent1 and 2 bind two Cdc42–GAPs ( GTPase activating proteins ) , Rga1 and Rga2 , and this interaction is essential for function ( Aguilar et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly RLIP76/RalBP1 , a protein with Cdc42 GAP activity , interacts with the ENTH domain of epsin ( Rossé et al', ', 2003 ) , although there is no clear sequence homology between RLIP76/RalBP1 and Rga proteins . In view of the modulatory role of Cdc42 in the nucleation of N-WASP-Arp 2/3-dependent actin nucleation at endocytic clathrin-coated pits , the recruitment of a Cdc42–GAP by epsin could help explain why actin nucleation is enhanced in epsin null cells', 'A very strong link between epsin and actin is consistent with evidence for a general and evolutionarily conserved role of actin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis , which is more prominent under conditions of high plasma membrane tensions ( Merrifield et al . , 2005; Kaksonen et al . , 2006; Ferguson et al . , 2009; Boulant et al . , 2011; Taylor et al . , 2012 )', 'The force of actin polymerization may help drive the deep invagination of the pits and also assist in dynamin-dependent fission ( Itoh et al . , 2005; Roux et al . , 2006 ) by developing a force that drives the deeply invaginated bud away from the plasma membrane', 'The occurrence of this force is well demonstrated by the dramatic actin-dependent elongation of the clathrin-coated pit necks in living cells and in cell-free systems ( Ferguson et al . , 2009; Wu et al . , 2010 ) , when the fission reaction is impaired by the lack of dynamin ( living cells ) or block of its GTPase activity ( cell-free system ) , respectively', 'Clearly , however , epsin does not simply function as a negative regulator of actin polymerization , but it is required for proper spatial organization of the actin-based cytoskeleton , as exemplified by the abnormal localization of myosin 1E at sites of endocytic invaginations on plasma membrane sheets incubated with epsin TKO cytosol', 'We note that partial deficiency of epsin function has a major impact on intercellular signaling mediated by Notch ( Overstreet et al . , 2003; Chen et al . , 2009 ) . It was proposed that Notch activation requires a pulling force applied to Notch by the endocytosis of its ligand in the neighboring cell and that epsin may be essential for the generation of such force ( Meloty-Kapella et al', ', 2012; Musse et al . , 2012; Shergill et al . , 2012 ) . Based on our findings , such a requirement for epsin may be linked to its role in the control of actin dynamics at clathrin-coated pits . Reported roles of epsin in clathrin-independent endocytosis may also be linked to its function in actin regulation ( Sigismund et al . , 2005 )', \"Another important finding of our study is a weak interaction of epsin's ENTH domain with the SNARE synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2 . As intracellular vesicles need SNAREs to fuse with their target membranes , a coupling must exist between vesicle budding and incorporation of the proper SNARE ( s ) in the bud\", 'Accordingly , other coat adaptors with ANTH or ENTH modules , such as AP180/CALM and epsinR were shown to bind SNAREs ( Hirst et al . , 2004; Miller et al . , 2007 , 2011; Koo et al . , 2011 )', 'We hypothesize that the very low affinity of the binding of synaptobrevin 2 to epsin , which explains why such an interaction had not been described so far , may nevertheless be physiologically relevant when compounded by other interaction of epsin with the bilayer , other coat components , and ubiquitinated cargo proteins', 'Recently , it was proposed that a main role of epsin in endocytic clathrin-coated pit dynamics is to help mediate membrane fission via the membrane remodeling properties of the amphipathic helix zero of its ENTH domain ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 )', 'While this action seems plausible , our study strongly suggests that epsin becomes critically important at the earlier stages of clathrin coat maturation , as we have observed an accumulation of shallow and U-shaped endocytic clathrin-coated pits in epsin TKO cells', 'The diffuse , rather than punctate distribution of proteins that assemble at the necks of deeply invaginated endocytic clathrin-coated pits , such as dynamin 2 , endophilin 2 , and myosin 1E further supports a stalling of pits at an early stage in epsin TKO cells', 'In contrast to the observations made in epsin triple KD cells , we have not observed clearly multiheaded pits , although the dome of some pits was irregular . Multiheaded pits observed in epsin triple KD cells had been interpreted as reflecting a defect in fission . However , they do not have the constricted neck of multiheaded pits observed in dynamin mutant cells ( Ferguson et al', ', 2007 , 2009 ) and at least some of them could represent a clustering of shallow or U-shaped pits . We note that the multiple endocytic functions of epsin are consistent with its localization throughout the coat ( Hawryluk et al . , 2006; Sochacki et al . , 2014 ) , rather than a selective localization at the bud neck to mediate fission', 'Finally , our work also demonstrates a dramatic impact of the lack of epsin on cell division , extending previous observations made in epsin 1 and 2 double KD cells , where abnormal spindles were detected ( Liu and Zheng , 2009 )', 'Surprisingly , we did not find a major effect on cell division in cells derived from epsin 1 and 2 double KO embryos possibly because of long-term adaptation to decreased levels of epsin . For example , we have detected an upregulation of epsin 3 in epsin 1 and 2 double KO cells ( our unpublished observations )', 'Interestingly , epsin undergoes phosphorylation and mono- or oligo-ubiquitination ( Stukenberg et al . , 1997; Chen et al . , 1999 , 2003; Polo et al . , 2002 ) in mitosis and these covalent modifications impair its binding to clathrin and AP-2 , suggesting a switch of its function in the mitotic cytosol ( Chen et al . , 1999 )', 'A role of epsin in the dynamics of the cytoskeleton may underlie its role in mitosis , for example by affecting its anchoring to the cell cortex . Several other endocytic proteins , including clathrin , are also implicated in mitosis , and , in particular , in cytokinesis ( Royle , 2013 )', 'In conclusion , our results reveal new aspects of the collective function of the three epsin genes and point to epsin as an important coordinator of the dynamics of endocytic clathrin coats from early to late stages . Our findings , along with previous studies suggest the models depicted in Figure 7', 'Epsin is an early component of endocytic clathrin-coated pits , which interacts directly with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , AP-2 , clathrin , and other early clathrin-coated pit components such as intersectin and Eps15', 'The partial bilayer penetration of its ENTH domain makes it optimally suited to function at a site where membrane buckling occurs ( as a generator , sensor or stabilizer of curvature ) , while its low affinity binding to synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2 may collaborate with AP180/CALM to ensure the coupling of bud nucleation to a membrane patch containing SNAREs', 'It may additionally participate in the recruitment to the pit of ubiquitinated cargo proteins via its UIMs , a function that does not apply to Dictyostelium epsin , which expresses a single epsin family protein lacking UIMs . As the bud expands , epsin along with Hip1R provide a link between actin nucleation and coat maturation , which is required for deep invagination', 'Finally , the membrane insertion properties of its helix zero may assist dynamin in the fission reaction . As we show here , however , its most critical function is at the transition between shallow/U-shaped and deep invaginated pits . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03311 . 013Figure 7 .

This coupling helps invaginate the pit . Only epsin localized at the equator of the bud is shown to emphasize its actin-related function in pit invagination , but epsin is not restricted to the equator', 'Higher magnification representation of the interactions of epsin ( right ) : the N-terminal ENTH domain binds ( 1 ) the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2-rich membrane bilayer of the plasma membrane ( and partially penetrates it ) , ( 2 ) the ANTH domain of Hip1R , and ( 3 ) synaptobrevin2/VAMP2; its tail binds ( 1 ) ubiquitinated cargo proteins ( via UIMs ) , ( 2 ) AP-2 and clathrin heavy chain ( via DPF/DPW motifs and ‘clathrin boxes’ , respectively ) , and ( 3 ) the EH domain region of Eps15 ( via NPF motifs )', \"Epsin's tail also binds F-actin and co-operates with the THATCH domain of Hip1R in the coupling of the actin cytoskeleton to the clathrin-coated pit .

Additionally , the link between epsin/Hip1R and actin is required for the deep invagination of the pit , and this is the process at which the action of epsin becomes essential', \"Subsequently , the force produced by actin and the bilayer destabilizing properties of epsin's ENTH domain may co-operate with dynamin in fission .

ABa and ABp cells from formincyk-1 ( ts ) embryos were similar to the one-cell embryo ( Davies et al', ', 2014 ) : they started to fail in cytokinesis at 19 and 21°C , respectively , and both blastomeres failed in cytokinesis 100% of the time when upshifted to fully restrictive temperature ( 26°C; Figure 1C ) . In contrast , EMS and P2 cells from formincyk-1 ( ts ) embryos were relatively resistant to cytokinesis failure', 'Both blastomeres successfully completed cytokinesis 100% of the time below\\xa0~24°C and with high frequency even at 26°C , a temperature at which ABa and ABp always fail in cytokinesis ( 5/9 EMS and 4/11 P2 cells , versus 0/5 ABa and 0/5 ABp cells , complete cytokinesis at 26°C; Figure 1C )', 'In fact , even at 27°C , a temperature at which even control worms start to show developmental defects due to thermal stress , ~40% of pre-anaphase upshifted EMS and P2 cells were still able to divide in formincyk-1 ( ts ) embryos ( 5/12 EMS and 7/17 P2 cells , versus 0/10 ABa and 0/10 ABp cells , complete cytokinesis at 27°C; Figure 1—figure supplement 2 )', 'Together , these data show that cytokinesis in EMS and P2 requires lower levels of forminCYK-1 activity than cytokinesis in ABa and ABp cells ( or the one-cell embryo , see [Davies et al . , 2014] ) , and suggests that cytokinesis in these cells is differentially regulated at a cell-type-specific level', 'To test for differences in the temporal requirements for these contractile ring proteins between the individual blastomeres , we next performed temperature upshifts from permissive ( 16°C ) to fully restrictive ( 26°C ) temperature with myosin-IInmy-2 ( ts ) and formincyk-1 ( ts ) mutant four-cell embryos at specific times before and after anaphase onset and monitored the frequency of cytokinesis failure in ABa , ABp , EMS , and P2 cells ( Figure 2A , see Materials and methods )', 'In control embryos , all four blastomeres successfully completed cytokinesis 100% of the time , irrespective of when the thermal upshifts occurred ( n\\xa0≥\\xa057 for each cell type; Figure 2B )', 'In myosin-IInmy-2 ( ts ) embryos , all four blastomeres were similar to the one-cell embryo and failed in cytokinesis 100% of the time whether upshifted before anaphase onset or later , up to\\xa0≤10 min after anaphase onset ( just prior to contractile ring closure ) ( n\\xa0≥\\xa067 for each cell type; Figure 2B ) ( Davies et al . , 2014 )', 'Thus , we found that myosin-IINMY-2 activity is temporally required throughout cytokinesis in all four blastomeres . In contrast , formincyk-1 ( ts ) embryos again showed cell type variation in the temporal requirement for activity among individual blastomeres . In our previous analysis of the one-cell C', 'elegans embryo , cytokinesis failed 100% of the time with forminCYK-1 inactivation by thermal upshift to restrictive temperature at any time before mid-ring constriction ( Davies et al . , 2014 ) . Consistent with this , ABa and ABp cells in formincyk-1 ( ts ) embryos failed in cytokinesis 100% of the time when upshifted to 26°C prior to anaphase onset ( n\\xa0≥\\xa061 for each cell type; Figure 2B )', 'However , ABa and ABp cells differed in their temporal requirement for forminCYK-1 activity when upshifted\\xa0≤10 min after anaphase onset: while ABa cells failed in cytokinesis 100% of the time , ABp cells failed only\\xa0~50% of the time ( n\\xa0≥\\xa061 for each cell type; Figure 2B ) . EMS and P2 cells in formincyk-1 ( ts ) mutant embryos exhibited even more dramatic differences in cytokinesis failure', 'A number of these cells successfully divided when upshifted to 26°C well before anaphase onset ( 14/43 EMS and 16/50 P2 cells complete cytokinesis ) ( Figures 2B and C ) and showed substantial equatorial constriction and frequent successful cytokinesis when upshifted to 26°C after anaphase onset ( Figure 2B; Figure 2—figure supplement 1 )', 'Thus , while forminCYK-1 activity is essential in ABa and ABp , with ABa requiring high functional levels of forminCYK-1 activity throughout the entirety of cytokinesis and ABp requiring forminCYK-1 activity only early in contractile ring assembly and constriction ( like in the 1 cell embryo , see [Davies et al . , 2014] ) , EMS and P2 cells have lower overall requirements for forminCYK-1 activity', \"Taken together , our functional and temporal requirement analysis suggests that differences in forminCYK-1-mediated actin dynamics may underlie cell-type-based cytokinetic diversity . In animal cells , diaphanous family formin-mediated assembly of linear F-actin during cytokinesis is thought to be essential for the assembly and constriction of the actomyosin contractile ring ( D'Avino et al\", ', 2015; Pollard , 2010; Severson et al . , 2002; Bohnert et al . , 2013 ) . ForminCYK-1 is the only worm diaphanous family formin ( Pruyne , 2016 ) . In formincyk-1 ( ts ) mutant one-cell C', 'elegans embryos at 16°C , F-actin is present in the contractile ring ( although at lower levels than in control embryos ) but , upon upshift to 26°C , linear F-actin is no longer visible and cytokinesis fails ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and [Davies et al . , 2014] )', 'It is possible that in EMS and/or P2 , another formin-related protein could function redundantly with forminCYK-1 to ensure F-actin assembly during cytokinesis in these specific cells . Transcriptional analysis has revealed there are two other formin-related genes ( inft-2 and frl-1 ) expressed at the four-cell stage ( Hashimshony et al', ', 2015 ) , but no formin-related gene is significantly over-expressed in either EMS or P2 , relative to in ABa or ABp ( Tintori et al . , 2016 ) . To test if other formin-related proteins could compensate for loss of forminCYK-1 activity during cytokinesis in EMS and P2 , we depleted the six other C', 'elegans formin-related proteins by RNAi in formincyk-1 ( ts ) mutants and monitored the success or failure of cytokinesis in the four-cell embryo . If another formin-related protein compensates for a loss of forminCYK-1 activity , then reducing the levels of that formin should increase the frequency of cytokinesis failure in EMS and P2', 'Instead , we found that individual depletion of the other formin-related proteins did not decrease the frequency cytokinesis failure in any of the four blastomeres in formincyk-1 ( ts ) mutants ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 )', 'This suggests that no single formin-related protein is compensating for loss of forminCYK-1 activity , although we cannot rule out that multiple formin-related proteins may function together during cytokinesis in EMS and P2 specifically . Although formincyk-1 mRNA levels do not vary across the four blastomeres ( Tintori et al', ', 2016 ) , it is possible that forminCYK-1 protein levels are higher in EMS and/or P2 , thus leading to higher forminCYK-1 activity and higher resistance to partial inactivation of forminCYK-1 function in these cells . To test this possibility , we tagged the C-terminus of forminCYK-1 at the endogenous locus using a CRISPR/Cas9 method ( Dickinson et al . , 2015 ) and generated a homozygous C', 'elegans strain expressing forminCYK-1::eGFP ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Using this strain , we imaged the four cell types after formation and partial ingression of the contractile ring in each cell type and found that forminCYK-1::eGFP localized nearly exclusively to the division plane during cytokinesis in all four blastomeres', 'Analysis of the maximum intensity projection ( which captures the cortical eGFP signal ) revealed that forminCYK-1::eGFP is present at similar peak levels at the division plane in all four cells ( Figure 3 ) . Sum intensity projection analysis ( total levels ) revealed that forminCYK-1::eGFP is reduced in EMS and P2 , versus ABa/ABp blastomeres ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 )', 'While the challenges of sum intensity projection analysis in multicellular embryos make it difficult to form conclusions about protein levels using this approach ( see Materials and methods for additional information ) , these results are consistent with the maximum intensity projection analysis and do not support the hypothesis that resistance to forminCYK-1 inactivation in EMS and P2 is due to an endogenous enrichment of forminCYK-1 protein in these cells relative to ABa and ABp at the four-cell stage', 'If multiple formin-related proteins function together to promote contractile ring assembly in EMS and P2 when forminCYK-1 activity is reduced , then F-actin at the division plane should remain at high levels in these cells upon temperature upshift in formincyk-1 ( ts ) mutant embryos', 'This outcome would also be predicted if stable , pre-existing F-actin filaments , rather than de novo forminCYK-1-nucleated filaments , comprise the contractile ring during cytokinesis in EMS and P2', 'Thus , we next measured contractile ring F-actin levels in formincyk-1 ( ts ) mutant embryos after the onset of equatorial constriction at the four-cell stage using the F-actin reporters Lifeact::RFP , PLST-1::GFP , and GFP::UtrophinABD ( Jordan et al . , 2016; Riedl et al . , 2008; Burkel et al . , 2007; Ding et al . , 2017; Tse et al', ', 2012 ) to label the entire F-actin cytoskeleton including the contractile ring ( Figure 4; Figure 4—figure supplements 1–3 ) . F-actin was enriched at cell-cell junctions and at the cell division plane in all four blastomeres in control embryos at both 16°C and 26°C and in formincyk-1 ( ts ) embryos at permissive temperature , 16°C ( Figure 4; Figure 4—figure supplements 1–3 )', 'In formincyk-1 ( ts ) embryos at restrictive temperature ( 26°C ) , F-actin was still present at the cell-cell junctions but was not enriched at the contractile ring during cell division in any of the four blastomeres , including in EMS and P2 cells that successfully completed cytokinesis ( Figure 4; Figure 4—figure supplements 1–3 ) . It is important to note that these C', 'elegans F-actin reporters are dim , even in control embryos; thus , our inability to detect F-actin on our microscope system with these reporters does not indicate an absence of F-actin in the contractile ring', 'Nonetheless , together with our formin-related protein RNAi mini-screen results ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) , the decrease in robust F-actin levels in all cells in formincyk-1 ( ts ) embryos at restrictive temperature suggests that equatorial constriction and successful cytokinesis in EMS and P2 is not likely due to F-actin assembly by another formin-related protein or due to utilization of pre-existing stabilized F-actin to form the contractile ring', 'Instead , it suggests cell-type-specific mechanism ( s ) allow cytokinesis to occur in the absence of a robust F-actin cytoskeleton in these blastomeres', 'To determine if robust cytokinesis in EMS and P2 could also withstand perturbations of the F-actin cytoskeleton independent of forminCYK-1 activity , we next tested whether cytokinesis in EMS and P2 is resistant to pharmacological inhibition of F-actin polymerization by treatment with low doses of the F-actin inhibitor , LatrunculinA ( LatA )', 'Embryos were first permeabilized by perm-1 ( RNAi ) , a gene required for normal eggshell assembly ( Carvalho et al . , 2011; Olson et al . , 2012 ) .

Another marker for successful P2-EMS signaling is spindle orientation in EMS cells', 'During extrinsic P2 to EMS cell-fate signaling , receptor tyrosine kinase ( MES-1 ) and WntMOM-2 from P2 activate SrcSRC-1 and FrizzledMOM-5 proteins/receptors in EMS to promote differential cell fate specification and proper spindle orientation during the asymmetric EMS cell division ( Figure 8A ) ( Goldstein , 1992 , 1993 , 1995a , 1995b; Rocheleau et al . , 1997; Thorpe et al', ', 1997; Bei et al . , 2002; Arata et al . , 2010; Schierenberg , 1987; Heppert et al . , 2018 )', 'Therefore , we tested whether the success or failure of cytokinesis in EMS-P2 doublets from control and formincyk-1 ( ts ) mutants correlated with proper orientation of the EMS spindle angle , which reflects proper SrcSRC-1 and FrizzledMOM-5 signaling and successful cell fate specification ( Figure 8B ) ( Goldstein , 1992 , 1993 , 1995a , 1995b; Rocheleau et al . , 1997; Thorpe et al', ', 1997; Bei et al . , 2002; Arata et al . , 2010; Schierenberg , 1987 ) .

Although we could not detect enriched F-actin at the contractile ring in EMS or P2 in formincyk-1 ( ts ) embryos at the restrictive temperature , we assume that a ‘normal’ , although F-actin-poor , contractile ring still forms in the cells that divide successfully', 'In our hands , relative to the one-cell embryo , contractile ring F-actin levels are reduced at the four-cell stage and fluorescent signals from other cortical F-actin populations ( such as the cell-cell junctions ) make it much more challenging to specifically quantify F-actin levels at the contractile ring in individual cells within multicellular embryos', 'Thus , we assume that the contractile ring signal in EMS and P2 is simply too dim for us to detect over background signals from other cortical F-actin populations in formincyk-1 ( ts ) mutants', 'In EMS and P2 cells that divide successfully upon forminCYK-1 inactivation , contractile ring constriction progresses more slowly ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) , suggesting that these cells are utilizing a sub-optimal contractile ring', 'Indeed , myosinNMY-2 is still essential for cytokinesis in EMS and P2 , indicating a ‘normal’ constricting actomyosin contractile ring is likely driving division in these blastomeres', 'Nonetheless , it is clear that , unlike one-cell embryos and ABa/ABp cells , EMS and P2 blastomeres are still somehow able to divide successfully with a substantially weakened F-actin contractile ring , whether weakened by inhibition of forminCYK-1 or application of low doses of Latrunculin A', 'An obvious distinction of these more robustly dividing cells is that EMS and P2 divide asymmetrically , whereas ABa and ABp divide symmetrically ( Rose and Gönczy , 2014; Arata et al . , 2010 ) .

During this cell fate specification event , the WntMOM-2 ligand from P2 activates FrizzledMOM-5 receptors on the surface of EMS ( Rocheleau et al . , 1997; Thorpe et al . , 1997; Bei et al . , 2002; Sugioka and Sawa , 2010 )', 'In parallel , transmembrane-domain-containing RTKMES-1 on P2 stimulates the same RTKMES-1 on EMS in trans , promoting SrcSRC-1 activation in both cells ( Bei et al . , 2002; Liu et al . , 2010; Sugioka and Sawa , 2010 )', 'Indeed , we found that both a high cell-cell contact area and proper spindle orientation , two indicators of successful cell fate signaling from P2 to EMS , are highly correlated with successful cytokinesis in EMS ( Figures 7 and 8 ) , and that depletion of SrcSRC-1 specifically causes division failure in the EMS cell , but not the P2 cell', 'In support of cell-fate signaling in cytokinetic diversity , both Wnt and Src-family kinase signaling have been implicated in both positive and negative regulations of cytokinesis in other cell contexts ( De Santis Puzzonia et al . , 2016; Fumoto et al . , 2012; Kasahara et al . , 2007; Soeda et al . , 2013; Kamranvar et al . , 2016; Avanzi et al . , 2012; Sánchez-Bailón et al . , 2012; Wu et al', ', 2014; Ikeuchi et al . , 2016; Jungas et al . , 2016; Kakae et al . , 2017 ) , and in human cancer cell lines Wnt5a , its receptor FrizzledFz2 , as well as a mediator of Wnt signaling , DishevelledDvl2 , all localize to the midbody at the division plane ( Fumoto et al . , 2012; Kikuchi et al . , 2010 )', 'Thus , Wnt and/or Src cell fate signaling pathway components may themselves , or via their downstream targets , function to protect against cytokinesis failure in the absence of a robust actomyosin contractile ring . Robust cytokinesis in P2 is cell-intrinsically regulated and independent of contact with other blastomeres within the four-cell embryo . The C', 'elegans P lineage forms the germline and cells within that lineage ( including P2 ) inherit distinct levels of cellular organelles , cell polarity proteins , and transcriptional regulators compared to the other three blastomeres in the four-cell embryo', 'In flies , germ lineage cells also divide more robustly ( by a specialized cytokinesis called cellularization ) and are resistant to some loss of function mutations in Anillin that completely block cytokinesis in somatic lineage cells ( Field et al . , 2005 ) . One possibility is that germline-specific inherited factors promote cytokinetic robustness in that lineage', 'For example , CAR-1 is an Sm-like protein essential for cytokinesis in the one-cell C . elegans embryo and is specifically inherited in the P lineage , including the P2 cell , via association with germline enriched non-membrane-bound , ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) organelles called P-granules ( Audhya et al . , 2005; Squirrell et al . , 2006 )', 'Perhaps the higher levels of CAR-1 ( or of other P-granule associated factors ) in P2 protect against cytokinesis failure in this blastomere . What advantage is gained from protection of these specific cell lineages against cytokinesis failure upon forminCYK-1 inactivation ? In the early C', 'elegans embryo , six founder cells ( AB , E , MS , C , D , and P4; Figure 1A ) give rise to all cell lineages within the adult worm . In the four-cell embryo , EMS and P2 are upstream of founder cell formation within their lineages , while ABa and ABp are descendants of the first-born founder cell , AB ( Figure 1A )', 'We speculate that the EMS and P2 cells may be afforded extra levels of protection to ensure that they give rise to their founder cell descendants ( E , MS , C , D , P4; Figure 1A ) , ensuring that all fates and lineages are represented in the developing worm', 'Additionally , both EMS and P2 undergo asymmetric cell divisions with each daughter cell inheriting specific organelles , transcriptional regulators , and other factors , so these blastomeres may undergo more selective pressure to develop protective mechanisms to ensure successful asymmetric cell division', 'Together , our data show that both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms contribute to cytokinetic diversity and promote robust cytokinesis when the contractile ring is weakened in specific cell types within the four-cell C . elegans embryo', 'Due to the similarities between cell fate signaling and cytokinetic machinery between worms and humans , we predict that similar regulation contributes to cytokinetic variation within cells of the human body to promote sensitivity or resistance to cytokinesis failure and therefore potentially mediate the onset or prevention of cell-type-specific pathologies . \\n C', 'elegans were maintained on standard nematode growth media ( NGM ) plates seeded with OP50 E . coli as previously described ( Brenner , 1974 ) .

Consistent with this prediction , we demonstrate by electron and fluorescence microscopic studies that binding of Myo3 to Espin1 can further promote formation of Espin1-mediated thicker actin bundles', 'First we analyzed the sequences of the reported Espin1-binding THDI regions of both Myo3a and Myo3b , and found that the region contains a pair of repeating sequences in its N- and C-terminal halves ( Figure 1A and B , denoted as ARB1 and ARB2 for Espin1 ankyrin repeats binding region 1 and 2 as detailed below )', 'Using isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) -based quantitative binding assay , we found that purified THDI from both Myo3a and Myo3b can bind to Espin1-AR with high affinities ( Kd in the range of tens of nanomolars; Figure 1C1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A )', 'Inspection of the ITC-based titration curves indicated that the binding stoichiometry of the Myo3 THDI and Espin1-AR clearly deviates from the value of 1:1 ( Figure 1C1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) . We thus hypothesized that each of the two repeat sequences in Myo3 THDI may independently bind to Espin1-AR , forming a 2:1 stoichiometric complex', 'We verified this prediction by gel filtration chromatography and static light scattering experiments ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 1D ) . In the gel filtration analysis , addition of an equivalent molar amount of Espin1-AR to Myo3b-THDI resulted in a complex peak with a smaller elution volume ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2A )', 'Addition of another molar equivalent of Espin1-AR further shifted the complex peak to a smaller elution volume ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ) . However , further addition of Espin1-AR did not change the elution volume of the complex any more , indicating that Myo3b THDI is saturated by the binding of two molar ratios Espin1-AR ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2C )', 'To accurately determine the stoichiometry , we used fast protein liquid chromatography ( FPLC ) coupled with multi-angle light scattering ( FPLC-MALS ) to calculate the molecular mass of the Myo3b THDI and Espin1-AR complex . When mixed Myo3b THDI with saturated amount of Trx-tagged Espin1-AR , the fitted molecular weight of the complex peak ( ~109', '5\\u2009kDa ) matches well with the theoretical molecular weight of 117\\u2009kDa for the ( Trx-Espin1-AR ) 2/Myo3b-THDI complex ( Figure 1D ) , confirming that Myo3 THDI contains two Espin1-AR binding sites . Next , we divided Myo3b-THDI into two fragments , each corresponding to ARB1 and ARB2 as shown in Figure 1B', 'Both Myo3 ARB1 and ARB2 bind to Espin1-AR with affinities also in the range of tens of nanomolars and each with a 1:1 stoichiometry ( Figure 1C2 and 1C3 , and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C ) , indicating that the two repeating sequences in Myo3-THDI can independently bind to Espin1-AR with comparable affinities', 'The 1:2 stoichiometry between Myo3 and Espin1 is consistent with a previous finding that human Myo3a THDI lacking exon 33 ( exon 33 mainly encodes ARB2 ) can still interact with Espin1 ( Salles et al . , 2009 ) . To understand the molecular basis of the Espin1/Myo3 interaction , we solved the crystal structure of the Espin1-AR/Myo3b-ARB1 complex at 1 . 65\\u2009Å resolution ( Table 1 )', 'The structure revealed that Espin1-AR contains 10 ANK repeats ( Figure 2 ) , instead of 8 as predicted earlier ( Bartles et al . , 1996 ) . The repeats 2–9 each contains the signature ‘TPLH’ sequence at the N-terminus of the αA helix , so can be viewed as the canonical ANK repeats . Like shown in the recently determined structures of the 24 ANK repeats scaffold protein ankyrin-B ( Wang et al', ', 2014 ) and the 9 ANK repeats RNase L ( Han et al . , 2012 ) , the two ANK repeats capping the two termini of Espin1-AR do not contain the ‘TPLH’ sequence ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . We believe that these two non-canonical ANK repeats capping the two termini of Espin1-AR mainly play a structural stabilization role of the entire AR fold', 'The 10 ANK repeats form a left-handed superhelix with the αA helices forming the inner groove and the αB helices forming the outer surface ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . Clear additional electron densities lining the inner groove of the ANK repeats allowed us to build the bound Myo3b-ARB1 peptide model with high confidence ( Figure 2A )', 'The ARB1 binds to Espin1-AR in an antiparallel manner , similar to the binding mode between ANK repeats from Ankyrin R/B/G and their targets ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) as well as between ANKRA2/RFXANK and their targets ( Xu et al . , 2012 ) , suggesting that elongated inner grooves are common target binding sites of ANK repeats in general', 'The ARB1 spans nearly the entire inner groove , covering ~1230 Å2 of solvent accessible area . The N-terminal of ARB1 adopts an extended structure and binds to the C-terminal of Espin1-AR . The C-terminal of ARB1 forms an α-helix and binds to the N-terminal half of Espin1-AR ( Figure 2B )', 'The amino acid sequences of Espin1-AR from different vertebrate species as well as of the mammalian paralogs Espin-like proteins ( Shin et al . , 2013 ) are highly conserved ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . We mapped the sequence conservation profile to the structure of Espin1-AR and found that the residues in the inner groove of AR are highly conserved', 'In particular the residues in the ARB1 binding surface are essentially totally conserved ( Figure 2C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12856 . 006Table 1 .

Since the two complex structures are essentially the same , here we only describe the detailed interactions observed in the Espin1-AR/Myo3b-ARB1 structure , which was resolved at a higher resolution', 'The Espin1-AR/Myo3b-ARB1 interface can be arbitrarily divided into three regions ( Figure 3A ) . The first binding site is formed by the repeats 2–4 of Espin1-AR and binds to the C-terminal α-helix of ARB1 ( Figure 3A1 )', 'Two absolutely conserved tyrosine residues ( Tyr1267ARB1 and Tyr1268ARB1 , the double tyrosine ( ‘YY’ ) motif; Figure 3B ) and Leu1271ARB1 in the next turn insert into the hydrophobic pocket in the N-terminal of Espin1-AR ( Figure 3A1 ) .

Mutation of this residue together with Glu1263ARB1 to alanines decreased the affinity by ~10-fold ( Figure 3C , Figure 3—figure supplement 1D ) . The second region is composed of Espin1 repeats 5–8 and binds to the middle-stretch of ARB1 with an extended conformation ( Figure 3A2 )', 'Both the side chains and backbone carbonyl of Leu1259ARB1 are involved in the interaction . Asp205 located in the finger loop between repeat 6 and 7 forms a salt bridge with Lys1257ARB1 and a hydrogen bond with Gln1254ARB1', 'Mutation of Lys1257ARB1 into a reversed charged residue glutamic acid , together with Leu1259ARB1 to alanine substitution also decreased the affinity by about ~10-fold ( Figure 3C , Figure 3—figure supplement 1E ) .

Despite the high similarity , there are still a few minor differences . First of all , the C-terminal α-helix of ARB2 is shorter', 'The interaction is mediated by a hydrogen bond between Asp1294 and Tyr144 , instead of the more extensive interaction observed in Myo3b-ARB1 complex ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2B ) . Moreover , the positively charged residues in the N-terminus of ARB2 cannot be reliably built , probably due to the high salt concentration in the crystallization buffer ( 1 . 6 M ammonium sulfate )', 'Nonetheless , clear electron density can be observed near the negatively charged surface ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2A ) . Indeed , substitutions of these positively charged residues with Ala weakened the binding ( Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1G–I )', 'Furthermore , the involvement of more positively charged residues of ARB2 may compensate for the less extensive interaction in its shorter C-terminal helix , thus resulting in a similar binding affinity to Espin1-AR as ARB1 does ( 107 nM for ARB1 vs 53 nM for ARB2 , Figure 1C2 and C3 )', 'It was reported that a conserved region following the xAB segment of Espin1 can interact with the N-terminal AR ( Figure 4A ) and inhibit the actin binding activity of xAB ( Zheng et al . , 2014 ) . By comparing the sequence of AI ( aa 496–529 ) with the consensus sequence of Myo3-ARBs , we find that Espin1-AI bears high sequence homology with Myo3-ARBs ( e . g', 'the completely conserved ‘YY’ motif , the central ‘KxL’ motif , and the N-terminal positively charged residues; Figure 4B ) . Thus , we predict that AI may bind to Espin1-AR with a similar binding mode as Myo3-ARBs do . We used ITC-based binding assay to test this prediction , and found that Espin1-AI can indeed bind to Espin1-AR , albeit with a more moderate affinity than Myo3-ARBs ( Kd of 1', '32 μM vs 0 . 05~0 . 1 μM ) ( Figure 4C1 ) . Fully consistent with our structure-based sequence alignment analysis , substitutions of the two tyrosines in Espin1-AI to alanines greatly weakened its binding to Espin1-AR ( Figure 4C2 )', 'Given that the AI segment ( aa 496–529 ) is immediately C-terminal to xAB ( aa 462–487 ) of Espin1 ( Figure 4A ) , one might envision that the interaction between Espin1 AR and AI can conformationally mask the xAB’s actin binding activity and thus renders Espin1 in an auto-inhibited conformation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12856 . 013Figure 4 .

Based on our analysis , the most likely mechanism for Myo3a/b-ARB1-mediated stimulation of xAB’s actin binding may be due to the release of AI binding from Espin1-AR by direct competition of Myo3a/b-ARB1 binding', 'We designed biochemistry experiments to support the above model . If Myo3-ARB1 can indeed compete with AI for binding to Espin1-AR , then Myo3-ARB1 must still be able to bind to the auto-inhibited Espin1 but with an affinity weaker than binding to the isolated Espin-1-AR', 'We obtained highly purified N-terminal auto-inhibitory fragment of Espin1 spanning from AR to AI ( denoted as Espin1-1-529 , Figure 4A ) and the full length Espin1 ( denoted as Espin1-FL ) , and found that both proteins exist as monomer in solution ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) , indicating that Espin1 auto-inhibition is intra-molecular in nature', 'ITC-based assay further showed that Myo3a-ARB1 can indeed bind to both Espin1-1-529 and Espin1-FL and with a weaker binding affinity than binding to Espin1-AR ( Figure 4D1–3 ) , consistent with a partially blocked Espin1-AR binding groove by AI', 'We also noticed that the ITC titration reactions of Myo3a-ARB1 to Espin1-1-529 and Espin1-FL are endothermic ( Figure 4D1 and 4D2 ) instead of the exothermic reactions between Myo3a-ARB1 titrating to Espin1-AR ( Figure 4D3 ) , further indicating that the binding of Myo3a-ARB1 to the auto-inhibited Espin1 is not a simple direct association process between ARB1 and AR', 'To provide further proof , we truncated Espin1 from the C-terminus just before the AI ( i . e . , aa 1–494 , denoted as Espin1-1-494 ) and found that Espin1-1-494 binds to Myo3a-ARB1 with an affinity similar to that between Espin1-AR and Myo3a-ARB1 ( Figure 4D3 ) , indicating that AI is indeed responsible for the decreased binding of Espin1 to Myo3a-ARB1', 'Myo3a is known to localize at the tip of filopodia when transfected in heterologous cells like HeLa or COS7 cells , whereas Myo3b alone cannot tip-localize as it lacks ABM ( Les Erickson et al . , 2003; Salles et al . , 2009 ) . However , when co-expressed with Espin1 , Myo3b can bind to Espin1 and localize to the tip of filopodia ( Manor et al . , 2012; Merritt et al . , 2012 )', 'Similarly , Myo3a lacking ABM can only tip-localize when co-expressed with Espin1 . Deletion of the Myo3 kinase domain is known to render the motor in a constant active state in promoting the length of filopodia , thus we used Myo3 constructs lacking the kinase domain in the subsequent experiments ( Les Erickson et al . , 2003; Quintero et al . , 2010; 2013 )', 'We first tested the role of Myo3/Espin1 binding on Myo3a’s ability to tip-localize . To test our biochemical findings and to determine the impact of Myo3-ARB ‘YY’ motifs on Myo3-Espin1 interaction , Espin1 transportation ( i . e', ', tip localization ) and filopodia elongation , we co-expressed various Myo3aΔKΔABM ( lacking the kinase domain and the ABM ) and Myo3bΔK constructs with Espin1 in COS7 cells . Since both Myo3aΔKΔABM and Myo3bΔK cannot tip-localize by its own , we reasoned that when co-expressed with Espin1 , the Myo3 and Espin1 tip localization levels will determine the intactness of their mutual binding', 'As expected , both GFP-tagged wild type Myo3a ( lacking the kinase domain and the ABM , denoted as ΔKΔABM ) and RFP-tagged Espin1 localized to the tip of filopodia when co-transfected in COS7 cells ( Figure 5A1 )', 'Mutation of the ‘YY’ motif of either of the ARBs ( denoted as mARB1 and mARB2 ) only had a moderate or even unobservable effect on filopodia tip localization for both Myo3a and Espin1 ( Figure 5B ) , indicating that ARB1 and ARB2 may play some redundant functions in this overexpression system', 'Mutations of both ‘YY’ motifs ( mARB1+mARB2 , denoted as mARB ) significantly reduced the filopodia tip localization of Myo3a ( Figure 5A2 and Figure 5B ) . Similarly , deletion of one ARB had a moderate effect and deletion of both ARBs had a much more severe effect on filopodia tip localization of Myo3a ( Figure 5A3 and Figure 5B )', 'We have also tested the effect of the corresponding set of mutations or deletions of ARBs on Myo3b , and observed similar results ( Figure 5C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) as those of Myo3a', 'It is worth noting that the ratio of tip to cell body protein level of Myo3b is significantly less than that of Myo3a ( Figure 5B and C ) , which is also consistent with previously reported findings ( Manor et al . , 2012; Merritt et al . , 2012 ) , but the detailed mechanism for this difference is unknown', 'The above results demonstrate that both ARBs in Myo3a or Myo3b are important for filopodia tip localizations of Myo3 and Espin1 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12856 . 015Figure 5 .

It can be deduced that binding of Myo3-ARBs can first release the auto-inhibited conformation of Espin1', 'Perhaps more importantly , formation of Myo3/Espin1 complex leads to two Espin1 molcules to be juxtaposed to each other , forming a Myo3 cross-linked Espin1 dimer', 'Due to the large space between the N-terminal AR and C-terminal ABD in Espin1 ( Figure 1A ) , this Myo3-mediated cross-linking positions the two copies of Espin1 ABD at a distance considerably larger than those allowed by other known actin cross-linking proteins . Therefore , we predicted that binding of Myo3 may stimulate higher order actin bundling activity of Espin1', 'We used both fluorescent microscopy ( FM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) techniques to exam the Espin1-mediated F-actin bundles with and without the binding of Myo3 ARBs ( Figure 6 ) . Under FM , the F-actin alone showed only background signal when probed by fluorescence-labeled phalloidin since individual F-actin is too small to be resolved ( Figure 6B , left )', 'This is consistent with a previous report ( Zheng et al . , 2014 ) , and also directly revealed by our TEM study showing the nm sized F-actin filaments ( Figure 6B , right ) . When Espin1 was added into the F-actin solution , uniform needle like bundles could be observed under FM', 'TEM showed that the bundle size is ~190 ± 8 nm in width ( mean ± SEM ) ( Figure 6A1 and C , Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ) . According to the auto-inhibited model , these actin bundles are probably induced by the C-terminal ABD of Espin1', 'By adding ARB1 or ARB2 to Espin1 and F-actin containing solution , some of the actin bundles were cross-linked and formed clusters under FM and TEM ( Figure 6A2 and 3 ) . Similar phenomena have also been observed earlier using Myo3/Espin1/actin co-polymerization bundling assay ( Zheng et al . , 2014 ) , instead of the post-polymerization bundling assay employed in this study', 'From the TEM images , the diameter of the cluster is slightly larger than Espin1 only ( Figure 6A2 and A3 , Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C ) . Quantification of the F-actin bundle width from the TEM images revealed that the addition of ARBs slightly increased the width of the actin bundles , with 216 ± 9 nm for the ARB1 group and 218 ± 9 nm for the ARB2 group ( Figure 6C )', 'The above data suggest that the cluster is formed by the Espin1-ABD mediated actin bundles and the ARB1/ARB2 binding releases the xAB , providing an additional actin binding site for forming slightly wider and more branched actin bundles', 'Interestingly , when ARB12 were added to Espin1 and F-actin containing solution , significantly thicker , elongated , and less branched bundles were observed under FM ( Figure 6A4 , left ) , a morphology clearly distinct from that with the addition of either ARB1 alone or ARB2 alone', 'When examined under TEM , the thicker bundles appear to be composed of several thinner actin bundles as observed in the Espin1-ABD-promoted actin bundles ( Figure 6A4 , right and Figure 6—figure supplement 1D ) , indicating that Myo3-ARB12-mediated binding of Espin1 can promote/stabilize parallel actin fiber formation presumably due to Myo3 mediated cross-linking of Espin1', 'Quantification of the width of actin bundles formed in the presence the Myo3-ARB12 and Espin1 showed that the average width of the actin bundles are significantly larger ( 330 ± 20; with the thickest bundles reaching ~600 nm in width ) than the other three groups ( Figure 6C ) . As a control , Myo3a-ARB12 alone could not cause bundling of F-actin ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1E )', 'Based on these results , we propose a model that , first the Espin1-ABD is able to bundle F-actins , forming the thin F-actin bundles; then the two Espin1 binding sites located at the tail of Myo3 not only release the auto-inhibition of but also cross-link Espin1 , further assembling the thin actin-bundles into thicker parallel actin bundle fibers ( Figure 6D )', 'Therefore , one can envision that a key function of the Myo3/Espin1 interaction is to promote formation of thicker parallel actin bundle fibers in cellular structures such as stereocilia . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12856 . 017Figure 6 .

It is believed that the delayed hearing loss phenotype in DFNB30 subjects could be due to Myo3b compensatory mechanism ( Manor et al . , 2012 ) , a hypothesis supported by our results as well', 'With the help of the motor domain-mediated high affinity binding of Myo3 to actin filaments ( Dose et al . , 2007; Kambara et al . , 2006 ) , the full-length Myo3/Espin1 complex may have even higher actin fiber bundling activity than the Myo3-ABR12/Espin1 complex studied in this work', 'As such , our study reveals a previously unrecognized direct myosin binding-induced actin bundling activity regulation mechanism of an actin filament cross-linker protein', 'It also demonstrates an intimate synergistic action mechanism between two classes of actin binding proteins , namely actin filament-based myosin motors and actin filament cross-linking protein , in controlling actin fiber size and stability', 'It has been reported that another unconventional myosin in stereocilia , Myosin XVa , can form a complex with an actin capping protein Eps8 to regulate stereocilia elongations ( Manor et al . , 2011 ) , suggesting that working together with actin binding proteins to regulate actin skeletal dynamics might be a new mode of function for unconventional myosins', 'Fitting with this model , stereocilia in jerker mice are thinner in their diameters likely due to loss of Espin1-mediated higher order actin fiber assembly , easier to form tapered structures and easier to degenerate presumably due to stability decrease of less bundled actin fibers in stereocilia ( Sekerkova et al . , 2011; Zheng et al . , 2000 )', 'As one of the three known actin cross-linkers in stereocilia , the abundance of Espin is relatively low compared to fascin and plastin ( Shin et al . , 2013 ) . It has been proposed that Espin may play a regulating role in elongation and widening of actin bundle by concentrating at the tip of stereocilia instead of major structural cross-linking roles ( Avenarius et al . , 2014; Loomis et al', ', 2003 ) . Interestingly , the abundance of Myo3 ( both Myo3a and Myo3b together ) is similar to that of Espin ( a few hundred copies per stereocilium ) ( Shin et al . , 2013 ) , indicating that Myo3 and Espin1 may work together to regulate higher order actin bundle structure formation and stability in stereocilia', 'Both Myo3 and Espin1 are known to concentrate at the tips of stereocilia in hair cells and at the tips of filopodia when expressed in heterologous cells ( Merritt et al . , 2012; Salles et al . , 2009; Schneider et al . , 2006 )', 'It is possible that stabilization of the growing end of the actin filaments at the plus ends by both Myo3 and Espin1 is a critical driving force for actin filament elongations ( Avenarius et al . , 2014; Loomis et al . , 2003; Shin et al . , 2013 )', 'The Myo3 binding-mediated cross-linking of Espin1 cargo is in sharp contrast to the cargo binding-mediated motor dimerization and processivity induction known in a number of other unconventional myosins ( myosin V , VI and VII ) ( Lu et al . , 2014; Sakai et al . , 2011; Shi et al . , 2014; Yu et al . , 2009 )', 'Such large differences in their cargo bindings probably match with the distinct functional properties of these myosins . For a fast-moving cargo transporting motor such as myosin VI , it is important that the motor assumes as a dimer and gets activated for moving in one direction upon binding to a cognate cargo', 'In such a case , the binding of a cargo protein to the motor tail exerts large impact on the motor activity regulations . As a high duty ratio motor , processive and rapid movement along the actin filaments is not likely to be the main function of Myo3 , although the motor can still move towards the plus end of actin filaments ( Les Erickson et al . , 2003; Merritt et al . , 2012; Salles et al', ', 2009; Schneider et al . , 2006 ) . Instead , one of Myo3’s key functions appears to coordinate with its cargo protein Espin1 to regulate Espin1-mediated actin filaments assembly and stability', 'Whether such myosin binding-mediated cargo activity regulation is also adopted by other unconventional myosins , particularly for those not known to play transporting roles , is an interesting research topic in the future . We provide detailed structural information regarding Myo3b/Espin1 interaction', 'We demonstrate that the Espin1 binding sites in Myo3a and Myo3b are essentially identical and therefore are predicted to be functionally interchangeable . These findings provide a molecular explanation for the partially redundant functions of Myo3a and Myo3b in hair cells', 'This analysis also predicts that Espin-like proteins can also bind to Myo3 as Espin1 does , suggesting that the functions of Espin1 and Espin-like protein may also be partially redundant in tissues like stereocilia ( Shin et al . , 2013 ) . Such redundancies suggest that mutation of single myo3a or myo3b or defects in espin1 or espin-like may not always develop severe phenotypes in vertebrates', 'Moreover , we note that forked , the Drosophila ortholog of Espin , is expressed in bristle cells , a cell type that is enriched in bundled actin filaments ( Petersen et al . , 1994 ) . Drosophila Forked protein is predicted to contain five ANK repeats , corresponding to Espin1 repeats 5–9', 'The structures solved here of mammalian Espin1-AR should help for identifying potential binding partners of Forked-AR . Although Myo3a and Myo3b are highly similar , there are clear differences in terms of filopodia tip localizations ( Manor et al . , 2012; Merritt et al . , 2012 ) . Myo3a localize to the very tip of filopodia , while Myo3b distributes in a wider tip-base gradient ( Merritt et al', ', 2012 ) . The different tip localization patterns of Myo3a and Myo3b does not originate from the unique ABM of Myo3a ( Manor et al . , 2012 ) . Our study here suggests that their Espin1 binding THDI regions are not responsible for different localizations of Myo3a and Myo3b along stereocilia/filopodia either', 'It is possible that the kinetics and the F-actin binding affinities of their motor domains or other variable regions in their tails may contribute to such differences . Most of the unconventional myosins use their globular cargo binding domains to recognize their cargoes ( Lu et al . , 2014 )', 'However , Myo3 use their unstructured , yet highly conserved tails to recognize globular domains from their cargoes . Myo3 and another unconventional myosins , Myosin XIX , are not predicted to contain folded globular domains in their tail regions ( Lu et al . , 2014 )', 'Based on the results in this study , we anticipate that these two myosins might use different unstructured fragments in their tails to specifically recognize various cargoes . A very recent report showed that another region in Myo3a’s tail , which is located immediately N-terminal to the Espin1 binding ARB12 region , can bind to MORN4 ( Mecklenburg et al', ', 2015 ) , the mammalian ortholog of Drosophila Retinophilin . It is noted that Retinophilin can also bind to Drosophila NinaC ( Venkatachalam et al . , 2010 ) . Future studies are required to elucidate the molecular basis governing the Myo3/MORN4 and NinaC/Retinophilin interactions for better understanding of the interactions . \\n The coding sequences of Myo3b-ARB12 ( Accession Number: NP_796350', '2 , aa 1234–1333 ) and Espin1-AR ( Accession Number: NP_997570 . 1 , aa 1–352 ) were PCR amplified from mouse cDNA library .

A stromule-to-MT interaction was designated if these two structures were overlapping or not resolvable by confocal microscopy', 'However , since the resolution of confocal microscopy is relatively low , we verified the close interaction between stromules and MTs using transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . Microtubules were originally detected and described in plants using TEM and can readily be observed as hollow , tubule-like structures that are 24 nm in diameter ( Ledbetter and Porter , 1963 )', 'We were able to observe MTs by TEM and the close interactions of MTs with stromule tips and kink points ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . MTs were seen directly associated with the chloroplast outer envelope membrane at a kink point . Serial sections near the tip of a stromule that graze the chloroplast outer envelope membrane show MTs in line and in close proximity to the stromule', 'Since our initial observations were from static images of stromules interacting with MTs , to look at the dynamics of stromules along MTs , we used an established transgenic N . benthamiana MT marker line expressing green fluorescent protein fused with the tubulin alpha 6 ( GFP-TUA6 ) ( Gillespie et al . , 2002 )', 'In this transgenic line , we expressed NRIP1’s chloroplast transit peptide fused to TagRFP [NRIP1 ( cTP ) -TagRFP] to mark stromules ( Caplan et al . , 2015 ) . Time-lapse imaging of GFP-TUA6-labeled MTs revealed that stromules dynamically extended along MTs ( Figure 1B , Video 1 )', 'Kymographs of the motion showed stromules extending and retracting in line with MTs in a single direction ( Figure 1B , left kymograph ) or moving bi-directionally in opposite directions ( Figure 1B , bottom right kymograph ) . We also verified the stromule movement using another MT marker , the end binding one protein ( Chan et al . , 2003 ) fused to Citrine ( EB1-Citrine )', 'EB1-Citrine was initially chosen to examine the direction of movement because EB1 marks the positive end of MTs; however , the Agrobacterium-mediated expression often led to even staining of the MTs ( Figure 1C ) . Kymographs of the motion of stromules showed clear movement of stromule tips along MTs ( Figure 1C )', 'The time lapse video show the dynamic interactions of stromules with MT , including branching , tip contact , transfer between microtubules , stromule initiation and bidirectional extension ( Video 2 ) . Our results from using three different MT markers via transgenic and transient expression indicate that stromules extend along MTs', 'To quantify the motion , we manually tracked the velocity of stromules extending along MTs . All stromule extension was correlated with movement along MTs . The velocity of stromule extension was significantly lower when MTs were marked with EB1-Citrine ( 0 . 0565 µm/s ) compared to GFP-TUA6 ( 0 . 146 µm/s ) ( Figure 1D )', 'An automated algorithm for detecting stromule tips in maximum intensity projections was developed ( Lu et al . , 2017 ) . The MTs were segmented and skeletonized ( data not shown ) . Using the skeletonized images , the points of interaction ( Figure 1E , green ) and the points of no interaction ( Figure 1E , red ) were mapped over a time series ( Video 2 )', 'Linear arrays of interaction points along MTs were clearly seen in time points T\\xa0=\\xa06 , 12 , and 18 min ( Figure 1E ) . A retraction event had limited interaction with MTs ( Figure 1E , arrowhead ) . The algorithm only accurately detected the slower moving motion when EB1-Citrine was used as a MT marker , and therefore , was not used in other experiments', 'The length , velocities , extension and retraction frequencies , and types of motion were quantified manually in all other experiments . Stromules and the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) have correlated dynamics and three-dimensional arrangement; therefore , it was hypothesized that contact points along the ER direct their extension ( Schattat et al . , 2011 )', 'Since , our data suggested that the extension of stromules is directed by MTs , we examined stromules , ER and MTs simultaneously by co-expression of labels for the ER ( SP-Citrine-HDEL ) and MTs ( TagRFP-MAP-CKL6 ) in NRIP1-Cerulean transgenic N . benthamiana plants that mark stromules . Similar to the previous report ( Schattat et al', ', 2011 ) , stromules were surrounded by ER , but here we show that MTs direct the movement through ER ( Figure 2A; Video 3 ) . Imaging using a high-resolution airyscan confocal microscope revealed that the ER forms channels around the stromules , and MTs were found at the stromule-to-ER interface ( Figure 2B )', 'Time lapse studies under similar imaging conditions showed that stromule extension occurred actively along the MTs , while the ER changed its direction and formed a channel around the extended stromule tip ( Figure 2C , middle panel; Video 4 ) . The stromule continued to extend along the MTs past the ER and no longer formed a channel around the extending stromule tip ( Figure 2C , right panel )', 'These time-lapse studies indicate that stromule extension is active along MTs and ER reorganization follows stromule extension along MTs . To further demonstrate that stromules extend along MTs , we expressed the MT marker TagRFP-MAP-CKL6 in NRIP1-Cerulean transgenic N . benthamiana plants and then disrupted MTs using 20 µM APM or 300 µM Oryzalin', 'Compared to the DMSO vehicle control ( Figure 3A , top panel ) , depolymerization of MTs was noticeable 5 to 15 min after APM and Oryzalin treatment , leaving behind remnants of partially depolymerized MTs and an increase of the MAP-CKL6 MT marker in the cytosol ( Figure 3A , middle and bottom panels )', 'Although mock control with DMSO resulted in an increase in stromules compared to the infiltration media control , the APM or Oryzalin disruption of MTs for 15 min significantly inhibited this increase in stromule number ( Figure 3B ) . MT depolymerizers APM and Oryzalin not only decreased stromule number but also restricted stromules to MT fragments causing changes in stromule movement ( Video 5 )', 'Beak-like protrusions from chloroplasts that did not result in stromules were also observed in APM and Oryzalin treatment ( Figure 3A , asterisk; Video 5 ) , however , we did not determine if these increased with the treatments compared to the DMSO vehicle control', 'In the time-lapsed data set shown in Figure 3A , stromule length was gradually reduced during 15-min treatment with APM that was caused by stromule retraction and correlated with simultaneous depolymerization of the MTs and , eventually , complete retraction of stromules ( Figure 3A , middle and bottom panels , arrowhead )', 'Similarly , with Oryzalin treatment at 0 min , we observed a region of the stromule overlapped with a segment of the MT ( Figure 3A , bottom panel , T\\xa0=\\xa00 ) . As the time course progressed , the segment of MT became shorter and there was a corresponding reduction in the length of the stromule ( Figure 3A , bottom panels )', 'In that time-lapsed data set , at 15-min treatment with Oryzalin we observed that stromules completely retracted from and changed course from the MT ( Figure 3A , bottom panel , T\\xa0=\\xa015; Video 5 ) . These results indicate that the disappearance of stromules may be a combination of disruption of extended stromules and the prevention of induction of new stromules', 'Since our results from MT inhibitor studies indicated that stromule formation and extension require MTs , we tested the effect of stabilizing MTs using Taxol ( Schiff and Horwitz , 1980 ) . Infiltration of Paclitaxel-BODIPY conjugate into leaves of transgenic NRIP1-Cerulean N', 'benthamiana plants showed extensive MT stabilization after 30 min of treatment compared to the mock control ( Figure 3C ) and significantly induced stromules compared to mock control ( Figure 3C–D ) . Interestingly , after Paclitaxel treatment , we observed long stromules and multiple stromules emanating from individual chloroplasts ( Figure 3C , bottom panels )', 'These results suggest that MT stabilization is sufficient to induce stromules . To more specifically alter MT organization and dynamics , we knocked-down the expression of GCP4 in N . benthamiana plants using virus-induced gene silencing ( VIGS ) approach ( Dinesh-Kumar et al . , 2003 )', 'GCP4 is a subunit of the γ-tubulin complex and artificial miRNA ( amiR ) -mediated knockdown of Arabidopsis GCP4 resulted in hyper-parallel and bundled cortical MT in leaf epidermal cells ( Kong et al . , 2010 ) . We silenced NbGCP4 in NRIP1-Cerulean and GFP-TUA6 transgenic N . benthamiana plants to visualize the effect on stromules and MTs , respectively', 'Since amiR-AtGCP4 in Arabidopsis plants resulted in a significant growth phenotype , we first determined how many days of NbGCP4 VIGS resulted in a MT alteration without a severe growth phenotype . Four days after silencing , NbGCP4-silenced plants phenotypically looked similar to that of VIGS vector control plants ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A )', 'However , six days post-silencing , leaves of the NbGCP4-silenced plants developed a crinkled leaf phenotype ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B , right panel ) . In addition , at this time point , the NRIP1-Cerulean stromule marker begin to leak out of chloroplasts compared to the VIGS control plants ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1C , right panel )', 'Fourteen days post-silencing , NbGCP4-silenced plants showed severe growth arrest and morphological distortion ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1D ) . Thus , we observed stromules in leaf epidermal cells of the plants after 4 days of NbGCP4 VIGS , to minimize potential physiological changes that might occur due to the alterations of MT organization and dynamics', 'Although at 4 days-post silencing , NbGCP4 mRNA levels are reduced by only 50% in the silenced plants compared to the VIGS control plants ( Figure 4B ) , cortical MT organization was significantly altered in the leaves of NbGCP4-silenced plants compared to the control ( Figure 4A ) in a similar way to amiR-AtGCP4 in Arabidopsis ( Kong et al . , 2010 )', 'To quantify these changes , we used SOAX software that uses Stretching Open Active Contours ( SOACs ) to quantify filamentous networks ( Xu et al . , 2015 ) . SOAX analysis showed that MTs were more parallel or aligned in NbGCP4-silenced plants compared to the vector control ( Figure 4C ) , which was visible by displaying the MT direction by color-coding the azimuthal angles ( Figure 4D )', 'Quantitative SOAX analysis shows that silencing NbGCP4 decreases the curvature ( Figure 4E ) and increases the snake length fitted to MTs ( Figure 4F ) . The snake length is not a direct measurement of MT length , since this approach cannot accurately distinguish between two MTs that are bundled together . Nonetheless , this measurement further suggests that silencing NbGCP4 alters MTs', 'The alteration in MT organization at four days-post silencing of NbGCP4 ( Figure 4 ) , resulted in more than twice the number of stromules in NbGCP4-silenced plants compared to the VIGS vector control ( Figure 5A , top panels; 5B , compare bars in mock treatment )', 'Stromules were on average significantly longer in NbGCP4-silenced plants compared to VIGS vector control ( Figure 5A , top panels; Figure 5C , compare bars in mock treatment ) . Furthermore , a greater percentage of stromules were longer than 3 μm in NbGCP4-silenced plants ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A )', 'We classified stromule movement into three types , smooth and constant movement , sudden and erratic movement , and side and tangential movement ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) and found that , in NbGCP4-silenced plants , stromule movements were more constant than those in VIGS vector control ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C )', 'We recently reported that stromules are induced significantly during an immune response against bacterial and viral infections ( Caplan et al . , 2015 ) .

Therefore , we tested if N NLR-mediated activation of immune response could further increase stromule number and length in NbGCP4-silenced plants . For this , we silenced NbGCP4 in transgenic N', 'benthamiana expressing N NLR and NRIP1-Cerulean ( stromule marker ) for 3 days and then infiltrated with p50 and 24 hr later the observations were recorded . As shown before ( Caplan et al . , 2015 ) , the number of stromules significantly increased in p50-treated VIGS vector control plants compared to mock-treatment ( Figure 5A , compare left panels and 5B , compare green bars )', 'The average length ( Figure 5C , green bars ) and percentage of stromules longer than 3 μm also increased during an immune response ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A )', 'Interestingly , the increase in stromules in mock-treated NbGCP4-silenced plants and a p50-induced immune response in VIGS vector control were remarkably similar ( Figure 5A , compare top right panel with bottom left panel; Figure 5B , compare mock-treated magenta bar with p50-treated green bar )', 'There was no significant change in stromule number in p50-treated NbGCP4-silenced plants compared to the mock-treated NbGCP4-silenced plants ( Figure 5A , right panels and 5B , compare magenta bars ) . Mock-treated NbGCP4-silenced plants also showed longer stromules compared to mock-treated VIGS vector control plants ( Figure 5C )', 'This increase was similar to that of in p50-treated VIGS vector control plants that showed significantly longer stromules compared to mock-treated plants ( Figure 5C , compare green open bars ) . However , there was no significant difference in stromule length in p50- and mock-treated NbGCP4-silenced plants ( Figure 5C , compare magenta open bars )', 'Collectively , these results indicate that the activation of immune response does not further increase stromule number and length in NbGCP4-silenced plants that exhibit constitutive stromule induction . The velocities of stromule extension and retraction were calculated as an indicator of stromule dynamicity and stability', 'The stromule extension and retraction velocities decreased in the NbGCP4-silenced plants compared to the VIGS vector control ( Figure 5D ) , suggesting that stromules were less dynamic and more stable . These results indicate that specific alterations of MTs are correlated with change in stromule dynamics and further support a role for MTs in regulating stromules', 'Interestingly , p50-treated VIGS vector control compared to the mock treatment reduced the velocities of stromule extension and retraction ( Figure 5D , compare green bars ) suggesting that stromules are less dynamic and more stable during active immune response', 'To test if p50-induced immunity alters MT organization resulting in alteration in stromule dynamics , we observed MT dynamics upon TMV-p50 treatment . For this , MT marker TagRFP-MAP-CKL6 was infiltrated into transgenic N . benthamiana plants expressing N NLR and NRIP1-Cerulean ( NN ) or expressing only NRIP1-Celulean without N NLR ( nn )', '12 hr later , p50 was infiltrated into the same spot to induce an immune response . After 48 hr of TagRFP-MAP-CKL6 expression and 36 hr of p50 expression , the MT cytoskeleton was imaged and then analyzed by SOAX', 'Visible differences in MTs between immunity-induced plants ( Figure 5E , NN\\xa0+\\xa0p50 ) and non-immunity-induced plants ( Figure 5E , nn\\xa0+p50 ) were difficult to observed in the images , but interestingly , SOAX analysis revealed that p50-induced immunity altered MT morphology ( Figure 5F–H )', 'Specifically , there were minor differences in orientation ( Figure 5F ) , curvatures were significantly smaller ( Figure 5G ) and snake lengths were larger ( Figure 5H ) in NN\\xa0+\\xa0p50 compared to nn\\xa0+p50', 'Collectively , these results indicate that changes in MT organization caused by NbGCP4-silencing plants or during p50-induced immunity are correlated with changes in stromule dynamics , indicating a possible direct or indirect role for MT organization in modulating stromule dynamics', 'Since AFs were previously shown to regulate chloroplast movement and stromule morphology ( Kwok and Hanson , 2003; Kwok and Hanson , 2004a ) , we tested if stromules extend along AFs . We expressed Lifeact-TagRFP that labels AF ( Era et al . , 2009; Riedl et al . , 2008 ) in transgenic N . benthamiana plants expressing NRIP1-Cerulean that marks stromules ( Caplan et al . , 2015; Caplan et al', ', 2008 ) . Out of 73 stromule tip extension events from 34 cells , the vast majority ( 93% ) of stromule tip extensions were not observed along AFs . Stromules were occasionally observed to be aligned with AF ( Figure 6A , asterisk ) , but high-resolution examination showed that they were not co-localizing ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 )', 'Instead , in many cases , stromules interacted at restricted foci ( Figure 6A , arrowheads ) that often corresponded with a kink in the stromule . We verified these interactions using TEM and found an AF bundle in close proximity to the apex of a stromule kink ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–B )', 'Stromule tips often reached actin filaments ( Figure 6A , arrows ) ; however , time-lapse videos showed stromules interacting with AFs , but not extending along AFs ( Video 6 ) . To determine if actin plays another role in stromule dynamics , we performed time-lapse studies in epidermal cells expressing the actin marker Lifeact-TagRFP', 'Stromules appeared to interact statically , and not dynamically , with AFs , suggesting there are actin anchor points along stromules . Interactions were observed at the tips or at kink points ( Figure 6B )', 'Kymographs and time lapsed video show that retracting stromules paused for multiple , consecutive time frames or stopped completely at AFs ( Figure 6C , Figure 6—figure supplement 1 , Video 7 ) . Due to the density of the AF network , stromules are often seen intersecting with AFs', 'To indirectly determine if those points of intersection are potential AF anchor points , we examined stromule retraction events . 19 . 4% of stromules retracted fully back to the body of the chloroplast without any pausing , often passing intersections with AFs . 77 . 1% of retracting stromule tips paused for multiple , consecutive frames and showed colocalization with an AF . 5', '7% of retracting stromule tips paused for multiple , consecutive frames , but did not colocalize with AF ( Figure 6D ) . The pausing of retracting stromules at AF cannot be explained by chance alone because the density of AFs and the colocalization of stromules with AFs observed appeared to be much less than 77 . 1% ( Figure 6A; Figure 6—figure supplement 1; Video 7 )', 'Therefore , this data suggests that there are actin anchor points along stromules . We further examined the interaction of stromules and AFs by expressing mTalin-Citrine in NRIP1-Cerulean N . benthamiana plants and then examining by high-resolution airyscan confocal microscopy ( Figure 6E )', 'AF marker mTalin-Citrine has been used previously to detect chloroplast-associated actin ( cp-actin ) ( Kadota et al . , 2009 ) . We could observe clear interactions of AF with chloroplast bodies ( Figure 6E )', 'Interestingly , we observed a clear thinning or constriction at the site of stromule-to-actin interaction points along the length and across the body of the chloroplast ( Figure 6E; arrowheads ) . Three-dimensional modeling shows grooves across the body of the chloroplast that correlate with AFs ( Figure 6E , Figure 6—figure supplement 2C–D )', 'Although the mechanism of stromule thinning at actin interaction sites is unknown , collectively these results indicate that AFs provide anchor points for stromules but not tracks for stromule extension', 'To determine the effect of AF disruption on stromule formation , we expressed mTalin-Citrine in NRIP1-Cerulean transgenic lines and applied 200 µM Cytochalasin D ( CTD ) to depolymerize AFs for 30 min ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ) . Since CTD treatment disrupted the actin network only in a fraction of the cells , only cells with a disrupted actin network were examined', 'Stromules were still present in cells where actin network was disrupted ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3A ) and the stromule number was similar between the CTD- and mock-treatments ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3B ) . Several studies suggested that MT and AF networks might work cooperatively for maintaining cell structure and physiology in eukaryotic systems ( reviewed in [Takeuchi et al . , 2017] )', 'Although stromule formation and extension is primarily associated with MTs , AFs might have a role in stromule dynamics . To examine the role of each cytoskeletal filament , we treated transgenic N', 'benthamiana plants expressing GFP-TUA6 that marks MTs and FABD2-GFP that marks AFs with longer treatments of low concentrations of cytoskeleton inhibitors that specifically disrupt one cytoskeleton component , but not other', 'These experiments are in contrast to shorter treatments of higher concentrations ( Figure 3 , Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ) that are not optimal for time lapsed acquisition of stromule dynamics . We found that treatment with 1 µM of oryzalin ( ORY ) treatment for 1 hr partially disrupted MTs and had no significant , visible effect on the AF network ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 , middle panels )', 'Next , we tested CTD treatment concentrations to disrupt AFs . 10 µM of CTD treatment for 1 hr fully disrupted actin filament AF network showing bright puncta of GFP-FABD2 , but only had a mild effect on MT organization ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 , right panels ) ; therefore , we used 10 µM of CTD', 'NRIP1-Cerulean transgenic plants were treated with either 10 µM CTD or 1 µM ORY for 1 hr to disrupt AFs or MTs , respectively , and then stromule length and dynamics were analyzed ( Figure 7A )', 'Interestingly , although average stromule length in both drug treatments were not significantly different ( Figure 7B ) , velocity of stromule extension was increased significantly in ORY treatment compared to DMSO control ( Figure 7C ) . Furthermore , CTD treatment resulted in significant reduction in velocity of both stromule extension and retraction compared to the control ( Figure 7C )', 'Interestingly , CTD treatment increased constant and smooth movements of stromules and reduced sudden and erratic movements of stromules , suggesting that CTD treatment stabilizes stromule dynamics ( Figure 7D ) . Together , these results indicate that both types of cytoskeletal filaments regulate stromule dynamics . While analyzing time-lapsed images of stromule movements in N', 'benthamiana transgenic plants expressing NRIP1-Cerulean , we observed the movement of chloroplasts in the direction of stromules ( Figure 8A; Video 8 ) or toward stromule kinks that are correlated with anchor points ( Figure 6 , Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ) . This observation suggests that stromules might direct or guide chloroplast movement', 'To examine if this movement is correlated with the interactions with the cytoskeleton , we co-expressed Lifeact-TagRFP that marks AFs and NRIP1 ( cTP ) -TagBFP that marks stromules in N . benthamiana transgenic plants expressing GFP-TUA6 that marks MTs ( Figure 8B ) . Stromules were anchored to AF and connected to MT for extension at 0 min', 'Stromules extend along MT at 1 min and retracted to the actin anchor point at 3 min . Stromule reextend on MT at 8 min . Retraction of stromule at 9 min led to movement of chloroplast body toward the direction of the stromule movement ( Figure 8B; Video 9 )', 'Next , we investigated if the stromule angle and the angle of chloroplast movement are significantly correlated and changed by ORY or CTD treatment . Since CTD treatment resulted in a complete disruption of chloroplast movement ( Video 10 ) , it was not analyzed', 'Chloroplast movement was first identified as any movement larger than the radius of the chloroplast body and the direction of the movement was measured as the angle from the start and end points of each movement events . If a chloroplast changed direction , that was considered a separate movement event', 'Only chloroplasts containing one or more stromules were used for this analysis because it depends on comparing paired measurements of the angle of the stromule from the chloroplast body attachment point to the tip and the angle of chloroplast movement . We compared 33 pairs for DMSO control and 47 pairs for ORY to calculate a circular correlation coefficient , r ( FL ) ( Fisher and Lee , 1983 )', 'An r ( FL ) value of 1 . 0 would indicate that the stromule angle and the angle of chloroplast movement are always identical , an r ( FL ) of −1 . 0 would mean the paired angles differ by 180 degrees , and if the angles are randomly matched the r ( FL ) will be close to zero . The r ( FL ) values for DMSO and ORY were 0 . 76 and 0 . 85 , respectively', 'To test the statistical significance , each data set was randomly shuffled 10 , 000 times and the r ( FL ) calculated for each randomization; the observed f ( FL ) values were greater than all the randomized r ( FL ) values , so for both DMSO and ORY the stromule angle and the angle of chloroplast movement were significantly correlated ( p<0 . 0001 )', 'Standard errors of the r ( FL ) values were calculated using the jackknife method ( Sokal and Rohlf , 1995 ) , and used in a two-sample t-test; the r ( FL ) values for DMSO and ORY were not significantly different from each other ( p=0 . 52 )', 'We generated a scatter plot of chloroplast movement angles and stromule angles , which shows a fairly linear relationship compared to the randomized control ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ) . To further visualize these data , we calculated the difference between the two angles and plotted the frequency ( Figure 8C )', 'If the chloroplast movement angle and stromule angle are equal , then the difference will be zero . We observed a higher frequency around zero compared to the randomized control . An examination of only angle pairs with less than\\xa0±30 degree difference were highly correlated and had an r ( FL ) value of 0 . 95; we therefore defined a stromule-directed movement event as being within\\xa0±30 degrees', 'The circular correlation calculation requires paired stromule angles and chloroplast movement angles , and excludes chloroplasts that move but do not have stromules', 'Using the\\xa0±30 degree criteria for stromule directed movement , we were able to compare the percent of stromule driven movement compared to total movement events , which includes chloroplasts without stromules This analysis shows that ORY treatment decreased stromule-directed chloroplast movement and CTD disrupted nearly all chloroplast movement , including stromule-directed ( Figure 8D )', 'It is possible that stromule extension or retraction may provide the driving force for stromule-directed movement . Therefore , we quantified how many times stromule extension and retraction events occur in 10 mins after 1 hr of drug treatment', 'Interestingly , ORY treatment significantly increased retractions and reduced the number of extensions ( Figure 8E ) ; however , the remaining stromules extension showed a higher velocity ( Figure 7C ) suggesting the frequency rather than the velocity of stromule extension is with correlated chloroplast movement', 'Overall , these results suggest that ORY treatment caused the reduced stromule-directed chloroplast movement due to less extension events . Our data show that stromules may direct chloroplast movement in epidermal pavement cells; however , it remains unknown if stromules provide a driving force or only guide chloroplast movement', 'The longer CTD treatment resulted in a complete disruption of AFs and nearly all chloroplast movement . Since chloroplasts are anchored to the AF network , we aimed to partially disrupt the AF network without fully abrogating all AF function', 'Treatment with CTD resulted in discontinuous AFs ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2A , magenta ) while the MTs were intact ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2A , yellow )', 'Examination of time lapsed maximum intensity projections of confocal micrographs showed that stromules were still present at 3 min and then briefly absent at approximately 8 min after CTD treatment ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2A , Video 11 ) . This brief disruption further supports that stromules are stabilized by AF anchors and disruption of AFs results in rapid retraction of stromules', 'However , despite the initial disruption , stromules re-extended along MTs and multiple stromules were observed after 20 min ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2A ) . These observations explain why the disruption of stromules by CTD was missed during 30-min treatment ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ) . Tracking the stromule and chloroplast movement ( Lu et al', ', 2017 ) showed that stromules can still direct chloroplast movement if AFs are only partially disrupted . One chloroplast ( Cp1 ) had restricted movement and colocalized with an AF fragment ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2A ) . Stromules were observed extending in opposite directions ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2B )', 'However , the second chloroplast ( Cp2 ) did not co-localize with AF fragments ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2A; Video 11 ) . The stromule of this chloroplast not only extended , but its extension along the MTs facilitated a rapid pulling of the body of down the viewing plane ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2C )', 'Our previous findings indicate that N NLR immune receptor-triggered immunity to the TMV p50 effector resulted in stromule induction , stromule-to-nuclear connections and eventual perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts ( Caplan et al . , 2015 ) . Electron microscopy results in our previous studies indicated that the chloroplast and nuclear membranes do not directly interact ( Caplan et al', ', 2015 ) , suggesting other cytoplasmic components are required for this interaction . To study the importance of cytoskeleton during the process of perinuclear chloroplast clustering , we expressed TMV-p50 to induce an immune response in N-containing NRIP1-Cerulean N . benthamiana transgenic plants ( Caplan et al . , 2015; Caplan et al . , 2008 )', 'Since stromules extend along MTs , initially , we marked MTs and looked at stromules to nuclear connections , but we were unable to find significant connections of stromules to MTs around nuclei . Therefore , we next marked AFs with Lifeact-TagRFP and found connections between stromules and AFs surrounding nuclei ( Figure 9 )', 'Time-lapse studies showed long stromules stably connecting to an AF attached to a nucleus for approximately 18 min ( Figure 9A , arrowheads ) . After 18 min of continuous imaging , a long stromule retracted , bringing the chloroplast body close to the nucleus ( Figure 9A , arrows; Video 12 ) . We verified these results with another AF marker , mTalin-Citrine ( Figure 9—figure supplement 1 )', 'We also observed that when the bodies of chloroplasts were in contact with nuclei , there were connections with AFs ( Figure 9B–C , arrows ) . Since p50-induced immunity leads to vigorous stromule induction ( Caplan et al . , 2015 ) ; Figure 5 ) , we hypothesized that more chloroplasts might move toward nucleus by stromule-directed movement of chloroplast body', 'Therefore , we quantified the perinuclear chloroplast clustering during TMV-p50-induced immune response in N-containing NRIP1-Cerulean transgenic plants in a time course ( Figure 10A–B )', 'Although majority of nuclei had a low number of interacting chloroplasts in the control ( Figure 10A , left panels ) , we observed a significantly higher number of chloroplasts around nuclei in TMV-p50-treated samples ( Figure 10A , right panels )', 'More than 80% of nuclei ( 85 out of 105 ) were surrounded by more than two chloroplasts in TMV-p50-treated samples compared to 50% of observed nuclei ( 56 out of 120 ) were surrounded by none or single chloroplast in the control ( Figure 10A and Figure 10—figure supplement 1A )', 'The ratio of nuclei-clustered with more than four chloroplasts was significantly higher in TMV-p50 treatment compared to the control ( Figure 10B and Figure 10—figure supplement 1A ) . These results indicate significant induction of perinuclear chloroplast clustering during an immune response', 'To determine , if AF anchoring plays a role in the immunity-induced perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts , we treated plants with CTD and ORY . Remarkably , CTD treatment significantly reduced the number of chloroplasts interacting with nuclei compared to the control and ORY treatment ( Figure 10C–D and Figure 10—figure supplement 1B )', 'These results support that anchoring of stromules to the AFs at the nucleus or more generally chloroplast movement is important for perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts during plant immune response', 'In conclusion , we propose a model in which perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts involves stromule anchoring to AFs surrounding nuclei and stromules guide chloroplasts toward nuclei during an immune response', 'Cytoskeletal elements in plant cells support several cellular functions , including cytoplasmic streaming , cell division , cell elongation , polar growth , vesicle trafficking , nuclear positioning and morphogenesis ( Cai et al . , 2015; Higa et al . , 2014; Li et al . , 2015 )', 'In this study , we show that dynamic stromules extend along MTs and AFs stabilize stromules and chloroplast-to-nuclear connections during innate immune response . Stromules have the ability to direct chloroplast movement , and AF anchoring of stromules may guide perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate immunity', 'Previous studies in non-green hypocotyls indicated a role for AFs and MTs during stromule formation ( Kwok and Hanson , 2003 , 2004a ) . The initial study ( Kwok and Hanson , 2003 ) used cytoskeletal inhibitors to implicate AFs and MTs during stromule formation , suggesting that AFs promote while MTs restrict stromule and plastid movement', 'Stromules visualized by differential interference contrast were observed interacting directly with AFs labeled with GFP-hTalin and rearrangements of the AF network changed stromule morphology ( Kwok and Hanson , 2004a ) . Movement along AFs was indirectly implicated by the identification of myosin XI cargo domain and a small tail domain that localize to chloroplasts ( Natesan et al', ', 2009; Sattarzadeh et al . , 2009 ) . Knockdown of myosin XIs qualitatively disrupted stromules ( Sattarzadeh et al . , 2009 ) or quantitatively decreased the percent of plastids with stromules ( Natesan et al . , 2009 ) . However , the dynamics of stromules moving along AFs were not examined in these studies ( Natesan et al . , 2009; Sattarzadeh et al . , 2009 )', 'Furthermore , longer myosin XI tail domain ( Reisen and Hanson , 2007 ) and full-length myosin XI ( Avisar et al . , 2008 ) do not localize to the chloroplasts . These studies prompted us to conduct a detailed time-lapse confocal microscopy of the dynamics of stromules and AFs . Surprisingly , our extensive investigations were unable to show extension of stromules along AFs', 'Instead , we discovered stromules were statically anchored to the AF network . Stromules were previously shown to actively move beyond AF attachment points via an unknown mechanism that was proposed to be either collisions with other components of the cytoplasm or interactions with very fine AFs ( Kwok and Hanson , 2004a )', 'Here , we have revealed that this unknown mechanism to be stromule extension along MTs by simultaneously monitoring MTs labeled with GFP-TUA6 , AFs labeled with Lifeact-TagRFP and stromules labeled with NRIP1 ( cTP ) -BFP via time-lapse confocal microscopy ( Figure 8B )', 'When our third revision version of the manuscript was under review , another report has proposed a model in which both stromule extension and slow anchoring occurs on MTs and rapid extension occurs on AFs ( Erickson et al . , 2017b ) . Our high-resolution imaging data clearly indicate that stromules do not extend along AF', 'Our data shows that static stromule anchoring is associated with the AF network and dynamic movement occurs along MTs . We used both Lifeact and mTalin , since they may label different pools of AFs . Lifeact results in even labeling of fine AF network and is accepted as one of the best markers for AF ( Riedl et al . , 2008 )', 'However , mTalin was used previously for labeling cp–actin interacting with chloroplasts and required for blue-light mediated movement ( Kadota et al . , 2009 ) . We have found that each marker has its own advantages and disadvantages , and no single marker is perfect', 'The actin inhibitor CTD disrupted the actin network , briefly destabilizing stromules which then dynamically re-extended along MTs . It is possible that myosin XI silencing is causing a similar effect , since knockout of myosin XI in Arabidopsis resulted in inhibiting distribution and dynamics of actin network ( Cai et al . , 2014; Park and Nebenführ , 2013 )', 'Early studies examining the role of MTs during stromule formation were conducted with MT inhibitors , APM or Oryzalin , leading to the conclusion that MTs have a limited role , because disruption resulted in either a 25% reduction in stromule length in hypocotyls treated with 5 µM of APM ( Kwok and Hanson , 2003 ) or no alteration of stromules in Nicotiana leaves treated with 36 µM of oryzalin ( Natesan et al', ', 2009 ) . A recent study also shows that stromules remained extended after 100 µM Oryzalin treatment ( Erickson et al . , 2017b ) . We show that both 20 µM APM and 300 µM Oryzalin can disrupt stromules in Nicotiana leaves; and propose that the difference between these studies may be caused by differences in either cell type or inhibitor concentration', 'The plastids in epidermal pavement cells in Nicotiana are chloroplasts ( Barton et al . , 2017 ) , compared to dark grown hypocotyls that lack chlorophyll-containing plastids ( Kwok and Hanson , 2003 ) . In general , the formation of stromules may vary based on differences in cell , plastid , or stimulus type', 'We found that 20 µM of APM or 300 µM of oryzalin MT inhibitor was required to observe a more complete disruption of MTs . By monitoring MTs and stromules with fluorescently\\xa0tagged markers , we were able to directly observe the effect of inhibitors on MT formation and found that stromules maintained interactions with small fragments of MTs , but retracted after complete disruption of MTs', 'The study using 100 µM Oryzalin also observed that stromules would remain associated to small fragments of MT ( Erickson et al . , 2017b ) . Although they did not quantify changes in stromule frequency or dynamics like we describe here , they qualitatively observed more fast moving , short-lived stromules', 'This is consistent with the overall increased stromule extension velocity that we measured after 1 µM Oryzalin treatment . The role of MTs during stromule extension is also supported by time-lapse confocal microscopy that shows stromule tips interacted and dynamically extended along MTs', 'This is consistent with the recent study also showing stromule extension along MTs using mOrange2-MAP4 ( Erickson et al . , 2017b ) . The involvement of MTs was unexpected because of the previously implicated role of AFs; therefore , we repeated these experiments with three independent MT markers , GFP-TUA6 , EB1-Citrine , and TagRFP-MAP-CKL6', 'To rule out potentially indirect effects of MT drugs , we further examined the mechanistic function of MTs during stromule formation by stabilizing MTs either chemically or genetically . Taxol , which stabilize MTs ( Schiff and Horwitz , 1980 ) , doubled the average number of stromules per chloroplasts . Furthermore , we altered MTs genetically by silencing NbGCP4', 'The γ-tubulin forms a complex with γ-tubulin complex protein ( GCP ) such as GCP2-GCP4 to form γ-tubulin ring complex ( γ-TuRC ) that plays an important role in MT nucleation and organization ( Moritz and Agard , 2001 ) . GCP4-GCP6 subunits are not essential for γ-tubulin complex ( Vinh et al . , 2002 ) , but these subunits are important for stabilizing the ring complex ( Guillet et al . , 2011 )', 'Knockdown of GCP4 in Arabidopsis leaf pavement cells resulted in hyper-parallel bundles of MT ( Kong et al . , 2010 ) . Our results showed that NbGCP4 silencing in N . benthamiana leaves exhibited similar changes in MT organization via SOAX analysis . The change in MT structure induced by NbGCP4 silencing was sufficient to induce stromules constitutively', 'Increased stromule length in NbGCP4-silenced plants could be due to less dynamic stromules , since extension and retraction velocities decreased . It is possible that the decrease in stromule dynamicity is caused by a disrupted balance between MT branching and MT bundling in NbGCP4 silenced plants . These findings support that MT dynamics are a key regulator of stromule formation and dynamics', 'It has been proposed that stromules may extend via an internal force , and not along MTs or AFs . Early studies have found filament-like structures in plastids and stromules , which potentially could provide an outward force ( Bourett et al . , 1999; Lawrence and Possingham , 1984 ) . Recently , stromules were shown to form in vitro from isolated chloroplasts ( Brunkard et al', ', 2015 ) ; but , clean chloroplast preparations resulted in only 1 . 1% of chloroplasts having short , spontaneous stromules and a 40-fold increase in stromules after the addition of cell extracts ( Ho and Theg , 2016 ) . We also have observed rapidly moving beak-like or small protrusions ( Video 2 , red dots ) that do not interact with MTs', 'They also resemble ‘chloroplast protrusions’ observed in alpine plants that form independently of MTs ( Buchner et al . , 2007; Holzinger et al . , 2007a; Moser et al . , 2015 ) . It was recently proposed that the small , fast moving stromules moved along actin because their rate of extension was similar to myosin motors ( Erickson et al . , 2017b )', 'However , when AFs were marked with Lifeact-TagRFP , we did not observe a correlation of these stromules extending along AFs ( N\\xa0=\\xa073 ) . These studies combined suggest that there may be an alternative mechanism for stromule initiation that may depend an internal force', 'Another alternative to cytoskeleton driven stromule formation is force derived from membrane contact sites ( MCS ) with the ER ( Schattat et al . , 2011 ) . Stromule and ER dynamics are correlated and it is possible that MCS stabilize stromules similar to actin anchors . They propose a model in which ER MCSs or the underlying cytoskeleton dictate stromule dynamics ( Schattat et al . , 2011 )', 'Our findings strongly supports a role for the cytoskeleton in which stromules require a combination of MT and AF interactions . Nonetheless , the function of the MCS between stromules and ER is intriguing and may assist in transfer of proteins , lipids or small molecules . Blue-light-induced-chloroplast movement in plants is driven by chloroplast actin filaments ( cp-actin ) ( Kadota et al', ', 2009 ) . The chloroplast unusual positioning 1 ( CHUP1 ) protein recruits actin to the leading edge of chloroplasts and is required for movement . Interestingly , the N-terminal coiled-coiled domain of CHUP1 is also required to anchor chloroplasts to the plasma membrane , revealing a complex , dual role of actin during chloroplast movement and anchoring ( Oikawa et al . , 2008 )', 'Chloroplasts are held by a cage of AFs ( Kandasamy and Meagher , 1999 ) and additional recruitment of cp-actin via CHUP1 potentially may inhibit stromules by forming a physical constraint . Consistent with this hypothesis , CTD treatment disrupts actin around chloroplasts causing them to lose their ellipsoid shape to become round ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2 )', 'Once released , chloroplasts moved in the direction of stromules extending along MTs . However , complete disruption of actin using longer treatments of CTD resulted in a complete disruption of all chloroplast movement , including stromule-directed movement . Stromule-guided movement was also seen without CTD treatment ( Figure 8 ) and appears to be a novel type of organellar movement along MTs', 'Over 50% of all the chloroplast movement in steady-state epidermal pavement cells was stromule-directed , suggesting that this type of movement may significantly contribute to chloroplast movement and positioning', 'Interestingly , stromules in the green algae , Acetabularia , also have been implicated in chloroplast movement ( Menzel , 1994 ) , suggesting that both cp-actin and stromule-directed chloroplast movement are conserved between land plants and green algae ( Suetsugu and Wada , 2016 )', 'We have recently shown that stromules play an important role during innate immunity and programmed cell death ( Caplan et al . , 2015 ) . During an immune response , chloroplasts move toward the nucleus and different types of chloroplast stromule-to-nuclear connections are established ( Caplan et al . , 2015 )', 'However , the mechanism behind perinuclear chloroplast clustering and chloroplast stromule-to-nuclear interactions is unknown . Our results described here using TMV-p50-induced , effector-triggered immunity indicate a role for AFs and MTs during perinuclear clustering', 'MTs promote stromule extensions , contributing to more stromule movement , while AFs provide anchors to position chloroplasts towards the nucleus', 'These results reinforce the role for AFs as anchor points for stromules that were also previously shown to exist in Arabidopsis hypocotyls ( Kwok and Hanson , 2004b ) , and a recent study showing that stromules are involved in maintaining contact with nuclei ( Erickson et al . , 2017a )', 'Overall , our results invoke a model in which , during effector-triggered immunity , MTs facilitate stromule extensions and stromules bind tightly to AFs around nuclei . The role of MTs during the formation of stromule-to-nuclei connections requires further studies', 'However , our data suggests that once those connections are formed , stromules may guide or pull chloroplasts toward the nucleus , which then results in perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts . Results described here show that MT-mediated stromule extension and AF-mediated stromule anchoring are two complementary activities during stromule formation and movement', 'We provide mechanistic insights into how interactions with the cytoskeleton form and stabilize stromules . Furthermore , we describe a new type of organellar movement along MTs that is stromule-directed and reveal a mechanism for perinuclear clustering during innate immunity', 'In the future , it will be interesting to investigate the molecular components required for stromule dynamics and stromule-directed movement and importance of perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate immunity', 'Plasmids used in this study includes mTalin-Citrine ( SPDK2681 ) , Lifeact-TagRFP ( SPDK2209 ) , TagRFP-MAP-CKL6 ( SPDK2386 ) , NRIP1 ( cTP ) -TagBFP ( SPDK3168 ) , TRV-NbGCP4 ( SPDK3111 ) , Citrine-p50-U1 ( SPDK 1939 ) , Citrine ( SPDK914 ) , and p50-2xHA ( TBS44 ) , NLS-mCherry .

Expanding our approach to temporal force fluctuation analysis at the length scale of a cell , we found that force propagation through cells can be intercepted by cell anchorage to the extracellular matrix and by actomyosin contraction', 'Together these results provide a first glimpse of the dynamics of sub-cellular force exchanges that yield stress homeostasis in quiescent and proliferating tissues . \\n Our first step in implementing high-resolution quantification of cell–cell forces built on the force-balancing principle was introduced in previous studies ( Liu et al . , 2010; Maruthamuthu et al . , 2011; McCain et al . , 2012 )', 'The principle states that traction forces exerted by a single cell , or by a cluster of cells , are in mechanical equilibrium with the extracellular substrate', 'Hence , the traction forces integrated over the footprint of a single cell or a cell cluster must be equal to zero ( Figure 1; see ‘The force-balancing principle and its application to larger cell clusters’ in ‘Materials and methods’ section )', 'Following from this , if the integrated traction force over the footprint of an individual cell within a cell cluster is non-zero , other cells in the cluster must balance it by force transmission through cell–cell adhesions', 'Thus , the residual traction force for a particular cell within a cluster determines the vectorial sum of external forces this cell experiences through cell–cell adhesions ( Equation 1 in ‘Materials and methods’ ) . In the case of a cell pair , each cell has one interface', 'Therefore , the residual forces associated with each of the two cells are—within the noise limits of traction force reconstruction—of equal magnitudes but opposite directions and indicate the force exchanged through that interface . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 003Figure 1 .

Integration of traction forces over the footprint ( color-shaded boundaries ) of a single cell ( column 1 ) or an entire cell cluster ( columns 2–4 ) yields a balanced net force of 0', 'In cell pairs and clusters with a ‘tree-like’ topology ( columns 2 and 3 ) , forces exchanged at each cell–cell junction can be determined by partitioning the cluster into two sub-networks and calculating the residual force required to balance the traction forces integrated over the footprint of each sub-network . See ‘Materials and methods’ for details', 'In cell clusters with a ‘loop’ topology ( column 4 ) , individual cell–cell junctions do not fully partition the cluster into disjoint sub-networks .

This suggested that the loss of cell–cell forces at the junctions of the dividing cell was balanced at other junctions in the cluster ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 )', 'For example , during division of cell 1 in Figure 4A–B , the two connecting graphical edges , edges 1 and 2 , exhibited decreases in cell–cell forces ( Figure 4F ) . In contrast , edge 5 , which was not directly connected to cell 1 , experienced an increase in force transmission ( Figure 4G; Figure 4—figure supplement 1 )', 'Similarly , during the division of cell 3 ( Figure 4B–C ) , there was an increase in cell–cell force at edge 6 ( Figure 4F; Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) , which was not connected to the dividing cell . These results show that , during major morphological changes , force fluctuations at individual cell–cell junctions can be dynamically compensated by forces at other cell junctions', 'Our time-resolved force measurements demonstrated that cell–cell forces at individual junctions fluctuate over time , both during interphase and cell divisions . We thus investigated whether and how basal force variations were coupled to the localization and recruitment of the molecular components of cell–cell junctions', 'We focused first on E-cadherin , the backbone of adherens junctions for epithelial cells . We correlated the E-cadherin-GFP intensities integrated along each cell–cell junction with the force measured for each junction and observed a positive and statistically significant correlation ( Figure 5A )', 'The positive correlation also persisted on a stiffer matrix ( Figure 5A ) , indicating that the overall relation between force exchange and E-cadherin recruitment is robust and independent of substrate compliance . We further validated the central role of cadherin proteins in mediating cell–cell force transmission by using function-blocking antibodies targeting E-cadherin directly ( Petrova et al', ', 2012 ) or by knock-down of alpha-catenin , an essential adaptor protein of cadherin-mediated adhesions ( Yonemura et al . , 2010 ) . Both perturbations resulted in a significant reduction in cell–cell force measurements ( Figure 5B–C ) .

Even for junctions less than or equal to 10 µm , we were able to detect cell–cell stresses', 'In fact , the distribution of cell–cell stress magnitudes for these short junctions is similar to that for junctions of all lengths , indicating that our analysis of cell–cell stress is not limited by cell junction lengths ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 )', 'Together , these analyses demonstrate that the FEM approach is able to extract significant sub-junctional variations in cell–cell adhesion forces . We also noted that for segments >40 µm , the correlation between local E-cadherin-GFP intensities and cell–cell stress measurements dramatically increased ( Figure 6C , black curve )', 'Since segments of this length could only be defined in extended , more mature cell–cell junctions ( Figure 6E ) , we suspected that this trend could reflect a particular property of this more stable population of cell interfaces within the clusters . We therefore repeated the correlation analysis for bins containing junctions of increasing length', 'Indeed , we found that the median as well as the entire distribution of correlations between local cell–cell stress magnitudes and E-cadherin-GFP intensities increased with junction length ( Figure 6F; Figure 6—figure supplement 1D )', 'Importantly , although the number of junctions per bin decreased with length , the correlation increase is not related to weaker statistical power because randomization abrogated the trend ( Figure 6G; Figure 6—figure supplement 1E )', 'These results are consistent with more qualitative reports that mechanical forces exerted by actomyosin contractility are critical for junction growth and maturation ( Shewan et al . , 2005; Yamada and Nelson , 2007; Borghi et al . , 2012; Brieher and Yap , 2013 )', 'Our measurements of cell–cell force fluctuations during mitosis also revealed spatial patterns of force transduction between multiple connected cells . When junctions were re-established after mitosis , those embedded in the cell cluster had lower force transmission compared to junctions at the cluster periphery ( network in Figure 4C; Figure 4—figure supplement 1B )', 'To further examine the spatial distribution of cell–cell forces , we categorized each cell in a cell cluster by the number of its neighbors or its degree of connectivity ( k ) ( Figure 1 )', 'With increasing k , the sum of cell–cell forces increased ( Figure 7A ) , which indicates that the cumulative force a cell experiences through its cell–cell adhesions increases with the number of connected neighbors . Strikingly , the increase in cumulative cell–cell forces for higher k-values was not paralleled by stronger cell–matrix traction forces ( Figure 7B )', 'Thus , contrary to the conclusions drawn from examining cell doublets ( Maruthamuthu et al . , 2011 ) , the generation and exchange of forces at cell–cell junctions can be decoupled from cell–matrix traction force generation , especially in larger cell clusters where cells have higher k values', 'This result is further supported by the observation that focal adhesions and traction forces are primarily localized at the periphery of cell clusters ( Figure 8 ) , consistent with a previous report ( Mertz et al . , 2013 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 017Figure 7 .

We examined the forces transmitted through individual cell–cell junctions by assigning each junction , or graphical edge , the two k values of the two cells it connected', 'The cell–cell junctions were then grouped according to the lesser of the two k values ( minimal k ) . Junctions with smaller minimal k values were closer to the cluster periphery , whereas those with higher minimal k were embedded in the cluster . In general , cells on stiffer ( 35 kPa ) substrates exerted higher traction forces compared to cells on softer ( 8 kPa ) substrates ( Figure 7B )', 'Interestingly , the dependence of traction force on matrix compliance was reflected in different trends of force transmission vs minimal k', 'On 8 kPa substrates , cell–cell forces at individual junctions were independent of the minimal k values ( Figure 7C ) , whereas the cell–cell stresses , calculated by normalizing cell–cell force to junction length , increased for junctions with higher minimal k values ( Figure 7D )', 'This is consistent with a previous analysis of cellular stresses in epithelial sheets , in which the stresses exerted between cells were proposed to be higher towards the center of the sheet ( Trepat et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , on 35 kPa substrates , the forces as well as stresses exerted on individual cell–cell junctions decreased with increasing minimal k of the junction ( Figure 7C–D )', 'Hence , for cell clusters on the stiffer substrate , the cell–cell forces were transmitted predominantly between cluster-peripheral cells and not across the cluster center . Thus , the spatial pattern of cell–cell force transmission is modulated by the mechanical microenvironment', 'To obtain further insight into the spatial organization of cell–cell forces , we investigated the dynamic transmission of forces through cells . We performed pairwise cross-correlation analyses of forces between opposing cell–cell junctions and between forces at cell–cell junctions and cell–matrix adhesions ( Figure 9A; see ‘Materials and methods’ section )', 'This analysis is based on the following expectations of cell mechanics: if forces are transmitted across a cell without coupling to cell–matrix adhesions , the forces at the two considered junctions should fluctuate with similar magnitudes and opposite directions ( correlation close to −1 ) , whereas the fluctuations of cell–cell and cell–matrix forces should not be correlated ( correlation close to 0 )', 'The opposite is true if forces exerted at one cell–cell junction are not transmitted across a cell but instead are transmitted to the cell substrate . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 019Figure 9 .

Therefore , we expected cells with downregulated paxillin or talin-1 to be mechanically isolated from the substrate', 'Indeed , the traction forces exerted by cells with reduced paxillin or talin-1 were significantly lower than the traction forces of control cells ( Figure 9—figure supplement 1D , H )', 'In cell pairs in which both cells had paxillin downregulated , forces at the cell–cell junction were unchanged compared to control cell pairs , indicating that paxillin knock-down did not affect cell–cell force transmission ( Figure 9—figure supplement 1C )', 'In talin-1-downregulated cell pairs , although cell–cell forces were lower than those of control cell pairs , cell–cell junction morphology was unaffected , and cell–cell force transmission was restored almost to control levels when the talin-1 downregulated cells were embedded in larger clusters ( Figure 9—figure supplement 1F , G , M )', 'Importantly , the correlation between the fluctuations of cell–cell forces in opposing junctions of a paxillin or talin-1 downregulated cell was higher than that between the cell–cell force fluctuations in opposing junctions of control cells ( Figure 9B )', 'For talin-1 downregulated cells , which exert very low traction forces ( Figure 9—figure supplement 1H ) , the correlation between the fluctuations of cell–cell forces in opposing junctions was in addition higher than that between the cell–cell force and traction force fluctuations ( Figure 9B , D–E; Video 5 )', 'These data showed that the decoupling from the matrix of a cell within a cluster promotes the transmission of forces across the cell , from one cell–cell junction to the next , in support of the force anchoring mechanism as one way a cell may attenuate long-range force transmission . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 021Video 5', 'Force exchange in four-cell cluster with mosaic downregulation of talin-1 on 8 kPa substrates; related to Figure 9C–E .

This shows that cells with reduced actomyosin contractility act as passive force transducers between other contractile cells in a cluster , consistent with the force scrambling mechanism', 'Using our generalized cell–cell force measurement and analysis method , we quantified , spatially and temporally , the transmission of mechanical forces through cell–cell junctions of dynamic adherent epithelial clusters', 'Combined with image analyses of cell–cell junction configurations and rearrangements in the living cell clusters , our data provided unprecedented statistical power and time resolution to address questions regarding force distributions and fluctuations within cell clusters , as well as their coupling to the recruitment of molecular components of adherens junctions ( Maruthamuthu et al . , 2011 )', 'To our knowledge , the proposed method is the first to resolve cell–cell force transmission dynamically with sub-cellular resolution . Yet , there are limitations that need to be considered with re-implementations of the approach: first , our method relies on a simple thin-plate model of the cell cluster that assumes homogeneity in material property within the cluster', 'In reality , the mechanical properties of the cell cluster may not be linear and isotropic elastic , as there may be spatial heterogeneity arising from differences in sub-cellular structures and cellular contractility . The assumption of mechanical homogeneity has been made also in stress distribution analyses on an entire cell monolayer ( Tambe et al . , 2013 )', 'In that case , the low spatial resolution tends to average inhomogeneity . The higher the resolution in imaging and the finer the spatial scale of the FEM analysis , the less likely is the cell cluster well represented by a thin-plate . How severe the resulting prediction error is depends on the cluster configuration and the noise level in the traction forces', 'In the present study , we validated the resolution of the inferred cell–cell forces by cross-correlation analysis of the spatial force fluctuations with E-cadherin density fluctuations along the junctions . These tests confirmed that despite the simple thin-plate model , cell–cell forces are resolved at the length scale E-cadherin-GFP intensities that fluctuate along the cell junction ( Figure 6 )', 'We therefore conclude that the model simplifications are in this case not severe enough to obscure spatial relationships between force and underlying molecular processes in cell junctions . Second , our method relies on E-cadherin-GFP signals for determining the location of cell–cell junctions', 'Imaging resolutions ( lateral and axial ) as well as diffuse signals in dynamic junctions may affect the precision of determining the cell–cell boundary locations and therefore the accuracy of cell–cell force calculations . Third , the method relies on enclosure of the entire cluster in the field of view', 'Without tiling the image acquisition , the cluster size is therefore limited to a maximum of 8–10 cells . It is important to note that increasing cluster size would also increase the error of force measurement , as the error of traction force microscopy sums up during the calculation of cell–cell forces', 'Thus for detailed analyses of small relative force variations in space and time , it is advised to restrict the cluster size . We have quantified cell–cell force dynamics in naturally forming clusters of up to nine MCF10A cells', 'Lastly , because the method derives cell–cell forces indirectly through measurement of cell–matrix traction forces , a fundamental assumption is that the measured traction forces fully capture all forces produced by the cells . Thus , the method implicitly neglects the dissipation of forces inside cells , which—in principle—may affect cell–cell junctional forces', 'However , experiments that attempted to determine the magnitude of dissipative forces suggest that these contributions may be small compared to the elastic forces analyzed by the present approach ( Keren et al . , 2009 )', 'One key observation we made is that , at the multi-cellular level , junctional force distributions fluctuate temporally and spatially in response to local variations in cell–matrix adhesions and cellular contractility', 'Although tissue reorganization has long been known as mechanically regulated , our method provides now the capability to monitor the dynamics of cell–cell junctional force exchanges during various morphogenetic events and thus the ability to correlate the induction and outcome of processes such as cell polarization ( Blankenship et al . , 2006 ) , mitotic spindle orientation ( Fink et al', ', 2011 ) , cell migration ( Toyama et al . , 2008 ) , and cell sorting ( Landsberg et al . , 2009 ) , not only with putative surrogates of force generation ( e . g . , myosin-II localization ) but also with actual force values', 'We show that mechanical forces may be balanced during major topology-changing events such as cell division by dynamic redistribution of cell–cell junctional forces within small cell clusters ( Figure 4 ) . The result suggests that force fluctuations at individual cell–cell junctions can be dynamically compensated by forces at other cell junctions', 'We speculate that this type of mechanical compensation occurs during cell division—and apoptosis—within larger tissues as well and may be the basis of tissue stress homeostasis to maintain mechanical integrity in a proliferating and deforming epithelium', 'Our method also provides insights into tissue mechanics by revealing that force transmission across a cell cluster is short-ranged , typically on the length scale of one cell diameter , due to the anchoring and scrambling of forces by cell–matrix adhesions and basal actomyosin contractility ( Figure 9 )', 'The longer-range force transmission previously observed and required for tissue morphogenesis processes , such as collective cell migration ( Tambe et al . , 2011 ) , is possible by the active regulation of force propagation', 'This can be accomplished by spatially coordinating the activation of actomyosin contractility above basal force levels , which yields a significant force exchange between neighboring cells , or by spatially coordinating the de-activation of actomyosin contractility and/or cell–matrix adhesion , which may increase the transduction range of basal force levels beyond one cell diameter', 'The notion of active propagation of mechanical forces across tissues via spatial gradients in myosin-II activation is supported by studies of epithelial sheet migration ( Ng et al . , 2012 ) and collective invasion of cancer cell clusters ( Hidalgo-Carcedo et al . , 2011 ) , in which an asymmetric distribution of actomyosin contractility promote cell cohesion', 'Based on our statistical analysis of over 90 cell clusters and over 250 cell–cell junctions in these clusters , it appeared that intercellular force transmission exhibits distinct spatial patterns in clusters cultured on soft vs stiff substrates , in which cell–cell forces are transmitted along cluster peripheral cells on stiff substrates , but through the cluster center on soft substrates ( Figure 7 )', 'We speculate that this may also be a result of the active interplay between cell–cell adhesions , cell–matrix adhesions , and basal actomyosin contractility to transmit , anchor , and scramble forces . As previously reported by the Dufresne group ( Mertz et al', ', 2012 , 2013 ) and shown here in Figure 7 and Figure 8 , focal adhesion numbers and traction force magnitudes are higher along the outer periphery of the cluster , suggesting that cell–cell forces are derived from cell–matrix forces that occur mainly at the cluster periphery . On stiffer substrates , where actomyosin contractility and traction force exertion are known to be high ( Discher et al', ', 2005 ) , the force anchoring and scrambling mechanisms are likely more active , preventing force transmission to the center of the cluster , whereas on softer substrates such mechanisms are less active , allowing force propagation through the cluster center', 'Although it is yet unclear how substrate stiffness precisely regulates cell–matrix adhesions , the cytoskeletal network , and traction force exertion in cell clusters , it has been shown that the differences induced by substrate stiffness can extend multiple cell layers into a cell sheet ( Ng et al . , 2012 )', 'Understanding how microenvironmental mechanical properties influence force transduction in epithelial cell groups may have implications not only for developmental processes but also for pathologies such as cancer where matrix stiffness is often altered ( Paszek et al . , 2005 )', 'Lastly , our cell–cell force microscopy method allowed us to correlate , in quantitative terms , cell–cell force transmission to intracellular molecular dynamics . We showed that , at the sub-cellular level , the variations in junctional forces can be coupled to turnover of E-cadherin-GFP at the junctions', 'Future studies can apply the same approach for analyses of other cell–cell junction molecules , including known force-responsive proteins , such as alpha-catenin ( Yonemura et al . , 2010 ) , vinculin ( le Duc et al . , 2010; Huveneers et al . , 2012; Thomas et al . , 2013 ) , and Eplin ( Abe and Takeichi , 2008; Taguchi et al . , 2011 )', 'With temporal and spatial resolutions at both the sub-cellular and multi-cellular levels , our method represents a tested toolkit for systematic investigation of the complex force homeostatic mechanisms required for the maintenance of a stress-resistant tissue', 'MCF10A expressing E-cadherin-GFP were generated by retroviral infection with LZBOB-neo-E-cadherin-GFP expression vector ( gift of MJ Wheelock and AB Reynolds ( Fukumoto et al . , 2008 ) ) and selected with neomyocin ( 300 µg/ml )', 'For experiments with mosaic cell clusters containing control cells intermixed with cells with knock-down of myosin-IIA or talin-1 , MCF10A-E-cadherin-GFP cells that also expressed H2B-mCherry were used , such that the nuclear marker could serve to distinguish between the control and the knock-down cells', 'MCF10A-E-cadherin-GFP cells that also expressed H2B-mCherry were generated by infection with the pBabe-H2B-mCherry retroviral vector and selected with hygromycin ( 300 µg/ml ) .

Thus , the integrated traction force for each individual cell within the cluster is non-zero ( i . e . , ∫ΩiT⇀ ( x⇀ ) dx⇀≠0 and ∫ΩjT⇀ ( x⇀ ) dx⇀≠0 in Equation 1 )', 'To maintain a net traction force of zero for the whole cluster , the non-zero integrated traction force of an individual cell must be balanced by a counter force from the neighboring cell ( s )', 'For a cell i in a cluster , this balancing counter force can be expressed as the negative of its integrated traction force , which we defined as its residual traction force f⇀resi , where f⇀resi=−∫ΩiT⇀ ( x⇀ ) dx⇀', 'Because the balancing counter force is transmitted by physical interactions between cells through cell–cell junction ( s ) , f⇀resi also represents the vectorial sum of all cell–cell forces exerted by cell i on its neighbors', 'In the case of a two-cell cluster , based on Equation 1: ( 2 ) f⇀i , j=f⇀resi=−∫ΩiT⇀ ( x⇀ ) dx⇀=∫ΩjT⇀ ( x⇀ ) dx⇀ Here , f⇀i , j denotes the force exerted by cell i on cell j and f⇀i , j=−f⇀j , i . Hence , by applying the force-balancing principle , we can derive the forces transmitted between two cells based on traction force measurements of the cells within those clusters', 'The force-balancing principle can be applied to all cell clusters with either a linear configuration or with a ‘tree-like’ configuration ( Figure 1 ) . In these types of cell clusters , an imaginary cut through any of the cell–cell junctions , or edges in the network representation , would divide the cluster into two disconnected cell groups', 'Therefore , at each of the edges , the cell–cell force transmitted can be obtained by summing up the traction forces over each cell group: ( 3 ) ∫ΩcT⇀ ( x⇀ ) dx⇀=∑i∈g1∫ΩiT⇀ ( x⇀ ) dx⇀+∑j∈g2∫ΩjT⇀ ( x⇀ ) dx⇀=0 ( 4 ) f⇀g1 , g2=−∑i∈g1∫ΩiT⇀ ( x⇀ ) dx⇀=∑j∈g2∫ΩjT⇀ ( x⇀ ) dx⇀ Here , f⇀g1 , g2 denotes the cell–cell force that is transmitted through the interface which connects cell groups g1 and g2', 'In our measurements , we calculated f⇀g1 , g2 by taking the mean of the two independent summations of traction forces for the two cell groups: ( 5 ) 〈f⇀g1 , g2〉=12 ( f⇀g1 , g2−f⇀g2 , g1 ) =12 ( ∑i∈g1∫ΩiT⇀ ( x⇀ ) dx⇀−∑j∈g2∫ΩjT⇀ ( x⇀ ) dx⇀ ) By reiterating the imaginary cut through all edges of the cell network , the force transmission at each cell–cell junction of a linear or ‘tree-like’ cell cluster can be determined', 'While previous studies either missed this generalized method or only applied it to a linear three-cell cluster ( the simplest cell cluster with greater than two cells ) , our work has now demonstrated the applicability of this method to many complex cell clusters with three or more cells', 'To calculate the strain energy of cell j in the cluster , we first calculated the displacement field u⇀j that is associated with the traction forces T⇀ generated by cell j alone . This was achieved by the following integral over the footprint Ωj of cell j: ( 6 ) u⇀j ( x⇀ ) =∫ΩjG ( x⇀−x⇀′ ) ⋅T⇀ ( x⇀′ ) dx⇀′ Here , G is the Boussinesq Green function', 'The strain energy Uj of cell j , which is a measure for cellular contractility ( Butler et al . , 2002 ) , is then given by: ( 7 ) Uj=12∫ΩjT⇀ ( x⇀ ) ⋅u⇀j ( x⇀ ) dx⇀ Note that simply integrating over the measured displacement field u⇀ ( x⇀ ) instead of u⇀j ( x⇀ ) would yield incorrect results . This is due to the fact that elastic forces are long ranged', 'For a cell cluster , this means that forces from one cell will cause substrate deformations outside of its own footprint , for instance underneath the footprint of a neighboring cell . In other words , u⇀ ( x⇀ ) within Ωj is not generated by cell j alone but contains contributions from all cells in the cluster', 'The above method of calculating cell strain energy accounts for these mechanical subtleties and includes only the cell-own strains in the energy calculation . We do note that the method neglects the energy a cell might have to use to strain the substrate in the presence of other cells', 'The E-cadherin-GFP fluorescence intensity signal was used to segment the cluster boundary as well as the cluster internal cell–cell interfaces . The cell cluster boundary was segmented automatically by first smoothing the E-cadherin-GFP fluorescence intensity image with a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of 5 pixels', 'The filtered image was then thresholded according to a ‘first minimum after first maximum algorithm’: the threshold value was selected by first finding the lowest intensity maximum in the image histogram , which largely corresponds to background pixels . The first minimum in the histogram after this maximum was selected as the threshold', 'The largest connected component of the binary image was identified as the cell cluster . To smoothen the cluster boundary and to fill small holes , we applied a closing operation using a disk with closure radius of 3 pixels as structuring element', 'Larger holes in the cluster that might arise during cell divisions or when cells join the cluster were not closed and were appropriately treated as cluster external space . The obtained tight cluster mask was then dilated by 15 to 45 pixels using a disk as structuring element , yielding the dilated cluster mask', 'The dilation was performed to ensure that all significant traction forces are included in the cell–cell force calculations . There are several reasons why significant traction forces may fall outside the segmented cluster region . First and foremost , the traction force reconstruction is limited by the spatial resolution of the bead tracking ( ∼2', '5–5 µm , dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio of the bead images and the substrate stiffness , with higher resolution for stiffer substrates ) . Second , cells at the cluster periphery often show finger-like and force-generating protrusions that are not detected by automatic cluster segmentation as they have a low E-cadherin-GFP concentration', 'Similarly , dividing cells exhibit retraction fibers that are barely detectable in the E-cadherin-GFP channel but seem to exert forces distant to the main cell body', 'The presence of these traction force vectors outside the cell footprint presents a dilemma: one would ideally want to cut off the thin-plate model at the tight cluster footprint , but then one would lose these ‘external’ forces when setting up the force balance for the cluster', 'We thus have taken an approach where we include these forces by extending the tight cluster mask but penalize forces with increasing distance to the detected cluster edge . Cell–cell interfaces within cell clusters were drawn by hand to achieve highest reliability of the interface location . The hand drawing was guided by the E-cadherin-GFP intensity maximum along the interface curves', 'In regions with broader intensity curves , we additionally used the traction force maps to optimize the interface locations by avoiding traction force vectors pointing towards the interface . This criterion was deduced from the commonly accepted notion that cells do not push but only pull on the substrate', 'The interface drawings were also performed by three different people to avoid personal biases . The obtained cell footprints and boundaries were stored as pixelated information . The cell position was defined as the center of mass of the cell footprint . The interface length was defined as the cumulative length of line segments that connect every tenth pixel of the interface curve', 'If the interface curve crossed a segmentation hole in the cluster , the pixels in the holes were not counted to avoid an overestimation of the interface length', 'The mechanical stress distribution within a cell cluster was inferred by modeling the ventral cell cortex as a deformable thin-plate , whose internal stress field σ ( x⇀ ) balances the sign-inverted traction forces T⇀ ( x⇀ ) according to Landau and Lifshitz', '( 1970 ) : ( 8 ) ∂σik∂xk−Ti ( x⇀ ) =0\\u2009in\\u2009Ωc ( 9 ) σiknk=0\\u2009on\\u2009∂Ωc Here , Ωc is the dilated cluster footprint that contains all significant traction forces and n⇀ denotes the outward normal to the dilated cluster boundary ∂Ωc . Indices run from 1 to 2 for the x and y in-plane dimensions , and the Einstein summation convention is used', \"Under the assumption that the thin-plate behaves as a linear elastic and isotropic medium , the plate-internal stress field is related to the plate-internal deformation ( Landau and Lifshitz , 1970 ) by: ( 10 ) σik=E ( x⇀ ) ( 1+ν ) ( εik+1 ( 1−2ν ) εllδik ) , where ε ( x⇀ ) is the strain tensor , δik is the Kronecker's delta symbol , and E ( x⇀ ) and ν describe the spatially variable Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio , respectively\", 'We set the Poisson ratio to 0 . 5 , reflecting that cell cortices are largely incompressible ( Boal , 2002 )', 'The strain tensor relates to the field of displacements u⇀ ( x⇀ ) as: ( 11 ) εik=12 ( ∂ui∂xk+∂uk∂xi ) Together , Equations 8–11 define a boundary value problem composed of partial differential equations ( PDEs ) that determine how the inverted traction force field propagates through the thin-plate , that is , how stresses inside the thin-plate modeled cell cluster cortex must be distributed to explain the measured tractions on the substrate and , at the same time , how these stresses must deform the thin-plate', \"The latter relation depends on the material properties of the cell cluster cortex , which are largely unknown . However , we found that the plate-internal stress field is practically invariant to the choice of the Young's modulus , consistent with previous studies ( Tambe et al . , 2011 )\", 'The reason for this is primarily that the solution of Equations 8–11 depends on the same material model to convert traction forces into plate deformation as is used to invert plate deformation back into plate-internal stress', 'Therefore in a first approximation , the terms describing the material properties are canceled out by the conversion of cluster-external tractions into cluster-internal stress', 'To test the validity of this approach , we compared the cell–cell junctional stresses derived from the PDE solution ( see below ) to the junctional forces calculated by the force-balancing principle in tree-like structures where the latter approach has a well-defined solution', \"Using a thin-plate model with a spatially homogeneous Young's modulus within the cluster , we obtained junctional stresses with a relative error that was comparable to the one of the force-balancing solution ( the relative errors are 14% for both methods , see Figure 2 )\", 'This result demonstrates that the error of both methods mainly originates from the uncertainty of the traction force measurement and that the FEM solution of the thin-plate model did not introduce additional numerical errors ( e . g . , due to numerical stress integration along discretized interfaces ) . For tree-like clusters , the two methods are thus interchangeable', 'This validity check on tree-like cluster , however , cannot be directly generalized to looped configurations . To this end , an alternative , yet missing , experimental method would be needed for cross-validating the thin-plate model', 'A more detailed cell model could yield a different stress distribution along the interfaces that may improve the correlation of cell–cell stresses with E-cadherin-GFP intensity as well as the prediction of cell–cell forces in looped configurations', 'We maintain that the material model assumptions are cell-type specific as epithelial cells , especially on softer substrates , tend to have relatively homogeneous cortical structures with few pronounced stress fibers . Moreover , the invariance of the PDE solution to the material properties may also be abolished under perturbation of certain pathways', \"In addition to setting Young's modulus constant within the cluster , we assumed that it decays exponentially with increasing distance d from the tight cluster mask: ( 12 ) E=E0e−dλ This assumption implies that pixels outside the tight cluster mask are less likely to belong to the cluster footprint as the distance increases . The length scale λ was set to 10 pixels =1 . 6 μm\", 'Given a PDE solution predicting the plate-internal stresses , cell–cell junctional forces f⇀m , n transmitted through the interface am , n between any two cells m and n can be calculated as: ( 13 ) ( f⇀m , n ) i=−∫am , nσikdlk Here , ( f⇀m , n ) i denotes the ith-component of the cell–cell force and dl⇀ defines a vector of length dl located on the cell–cell interface and pointing normal to the interface toward cell n', 'Of note , the interface am , n can represent the entire junction between two cells or only a short stretch of it . We used the second approach to calculate the dense force exchange profiles along cell–cell junctions . The boundary value problem was solved numerically using the finite element method ( FEM )', 'Specifically , we implemented Equations 8–11 in MATLAB using the ‘Partial Differential Equation’ toolbox . The triangular mesh was generated from the dilated cluster boundary curve ( every 10th pixel was considered ) using the function initmesh with the ‘Jiggle’-option to improve the mesh quality', 'The mesh was then refined twice with the function refinemesh and further improved with a final application of the function jigglemesh . The resulting mesh was much denser than the traction force mesh to minimize interpolation errors . The boundary value problem was solved over the generated mesh with the assempde function', 'An additional component of the PDE solution implicated numerical stabilization , which is necessary because of the experimental error in determining the traction forces . The error in the traction force measurement is reflected by the inequality ( 14 ) ∫ΩcT⇀ ( x⇀ ) dx⇀≠0 that is , the traction forces integrated over the entire cluster are non-zero', 'This would imply that the cluster is subjected to an accelerating force resulting in translocation of the cluster . However , a finite solution to the boundary value problem exists only if the traction forces perfectly cancel one another over the cluster area . To correct the instability introduced by Equation 14 we added a term κu⇀ ( x⇀ ) with κE0=10−7 to the left hand side of Equation 8', 'The resulting stress field remains numerically unchanged as long as the κ-value is chosen small enough , such that κu⇀ ( x⇀ ) is negligible compared to the other physical terms in Equation 8 . The FEM approach includes additional assumptions for calculating how mechanical stresses redistribute within a cell cluster', 'This was done by modeling the cell cluster as a thin , homogeneous , and elastic plate that is set under tension by the traction stress at the cell–substrate interface ( Figure 3A )', 'The internal cell-stress distributions were then calculated using the FEM such that the internal stresses were consistent with the measured cellular traction forces ( see ‘Finite element method for cell–cell force measurements’ ) . In the final step , the calculated cluster internal stresses were integrated along each cell–cell interface to obtain transmitted junctional forces', 'The assumptions of a thin , homogeneous , and elastic plate are well justified , as the studied MCF10A cells were relatively flat when adhered and spread on the polyacrylamide ( PAA ) gel substrates . The cells were typically only ∼1 µm thick ( except at the nucleus ) , while the lateral dimensions were ∼20 µm', 'Cells in the small clusters also did not show any significant , micron-sized structural organization of actin ( such as actin stress fibers ) along which mechanical stresses could propagate on the compliant PAA gels , supporting the homogeneous plate assumption', 'Furthermore , as we were only interested in the equilibrium distribution of mechanical stress in the cluster at certain time points , a purely elastic , rather than viscoelastic , description of the cells is sufficient . This model is very similar to the one used in monolayer stress microscopy', 'The main difference is the fact that in our approach , the cluster boundary is completely defined within the field of view . Therefore in our approach , a complete force balance equation for the cluster can be built up , which is impossible in monolayer stress microscopy', '( Note that in monolayer stress microscopy , it is unknown which stresses are transmitted at the margins of the field of view occupied with cells . ) Cells were tracked by a nearest neighbor assignment , that is , by linking cells with minimal distance between their cell centers in consecutive frames ( Burkard , 1999 ) . In case of a cell division , only the closest daughter was linked', 'The second daughter cell was considered as a new cell starting a new time course . Cell interfaces were tracked by minimizing the sum of three Euclidian distances , the distances between the two endpoints and their proximal correspondents , and the distance between the centers of mass . Pairs of interfaces that minimized this cost function among all possible pairings were linked', 'For the correlation analysis , all data were adapted to a fixed frame rate of 1/240 s . When a dataset was acquired with a higher frame rate , the time series were averaged over bins of 240 s . All time series were individually normalized to a variance of 1 before grouping several time series together', 'Cell–cell stress values were calculated at every 10th pixel along the cell–cell interfaces using the stress tensor σ: ( 15 ) σINTF , i=σiknk , where σINTF , i is the ith-component of the interface stress and nk is the kth-component of the vector normal to the interface . The average distance of two neighboring cell–cell stress points was 1 . 27 µm', 'The E-cadherin-GFP images were smoothed using a plain average filter with circular support of radius 10 pixels . For each cell–cell stress value , a corresponding E-cadherin-GFP intensity value was extracted from the discretized interface curve', 'The correlation coefficient of E-cadherin-GFP intensity and stress magnitude were then calculated as: ( 16 ) corr ( I ( x⇀ ) , σINTF ( x⇀ ) ) =cov ( I ( x⇀ ) , σINTF ( x⇀ ) ) var ( I ) var ( σINTF ) To obtain a mean correlation coefficient , all stress and intensity pairs of all interfaces of all clusters and over all frames of an experiment were grouped together ( Figure 6B )', 'The significant correlation coefficient obtained in Figure 6B suggests that FEM allows us to resolve meaningful interfacial stresses with sub-junctional resolution', 'To test this assertion and to determine the length scale over which force and E-cadherin recruitment are coupled , we calculated correlation coefficients for every interface in each frame individually , either with correct or randomized stress–intensity pairs . For randomization , the interface was subdivided into sub-junctional segments of length Δl', 'If a cell–cell junction was shorter than Δl , it was not considered in the analysis . If the interface was longer but not in multiples of Δl , the remaining fragment was complemented with neighboring data points to precisely match Δl . Randomization was then performed within each segment and one ‘randomized’ correlation coefficient was calculated for the entire interface', 'The correlation coefficients obtained from individual interfaces were then grouped together in a histogram ( see Figure 6F ) . For uncorrelated data , one expects a median correlation of 0 . Furthermore , the longer the segment length the more will the coefficient distribution tighten up with a peak at zero correlation', 'The length scale of cadherin-stress coupling was defined as the value of Δl for which the median correlation coefficient of the randomized pairs falls below 50% of the correct pairing ( Figure 6C ) ; this is to say that for shorter segment lengths , the randomized and correct pairings exhibit similar correlations', 'We cannot identify whether the abrogation of distinct correlation coefficients is related to the absence of finer force and cadherin co-variations or because FEM cannot resolve finer stress variations . Thus , this limit also may define an upper bound for the resolution of sub-junctional forces', 'To precisely quantify long-range force transmission in cell clusters , we performed a cross-correlation analysis of force pairs from two interfaces of a cell . Consider a cell that is surrounded by at least two neighboring cells , denoted as ‘m’ for the ‘middle’ cell ( Figure 9A ) . At any time point , the vectorial sum over all cell–cell and cell–matrix forces has to be balanced', 'A fluctuation in direction or magnitude of one cell–cell force vector exerted on cell m , say f⇀i , m , thus has to be counterbalanced by an opposite fluctuation of either the traction forces of cell m , f⇀resm=−∫ΩmT⇀ ( x⇀ ) dx⇀ , or by the cell–cell forces at the remaining interfaces of cell m , ∑j≠if⇀j , m', 'If the cell–cell forces are completely transmitted across cell m , then the cross-correlation between the cell–cell forces should be perfectly anti-correlated , that is , corr ( f⇀i . m , ∑j≠if⇀j , m ) =−1 . At the same time , no correlation between cell–cell force and traction forces should be found: corr ( f⇀i , m , f⇀resm ) =0', \"In the case where cell–cell forces are not transmitted across cell m , the forces should be decoupled , and their correlation should vanish corr ( f⇀i , m , ∑j≠if⇀j , m ) =0 , while the cell–cell and cell traction forces should be anti-correlated: corr ( f⇀i , m , f⇀resm ) =−1 . This anti-correlation means that the cell–cell force is locally counter-balanced by the cell's traction forces\", 'Implementation of this cross-correlation analysis is described in detail in the below section ( ‘Cross-correlation of cellular force vectors’ ) . All possible component-wise cross-correlations of two vectors in two dimensions can be expressed in matrix form as: ( 17 ) corr ( f⇀1 , f⇀2 ) =[corr ( f1 , x , f2 , x ) corr ( f1 , x , f2 , y ) corr ( f1 , y , f2 , x ) corr ( f1 , y , f2 , y ) ]', 'We note that the matrix is symmetric . In our specific case , the vectors are two cellular forces f⇀1 and f⇀2 that are balanced by a third cellular force , f⇀3', 'For example , when considering the correlation of the cell–cell forces , corr ( f⇀i , m , ∑j≠if⇀j , m ) , exerted on cell m , the f⇀1 corresponds to f⇀i , m , f⇀2 corresponds to ∑j≠if⇀j , m , and f⇀3 corresponds to f⇀resm , subject to the force balance f⇀i , m+∑j≠if⇀j , m+f⇀resm=0', 'Thus , it is expected that the off-diagonal components of the matrix in Equation 17 equal zero on average , and that only the diagonal components yield a significant correlation', 'Furthermore , as the choice of the coordinate system is arbitrary , the correlation of the two diagonal components should yield , on average , identical values and thus: ( 18 ) corr ( f⇀1 , f⇀2 ) =cf1 , f2[1001] , where cf1 , f2 is the average correlation of the x or y components , respectively', 'Numerically we calculated cf1 , f2 as the mean of the two diagonal components: ( 19 ) cf1 , f2=12 ( corr ( f1 , x , f2 , x ) +corr ( f1 , y , f2 , y ) ) .

Points outside the whiskers represent outliers', 'Non-overlapping notches between samples indicate that the sample medians differ with statistical significance at the 5% level .

      "\t ['Many membrane proteins fold inefficiently and require the help of enzymes and chaperones . Here we reveal a novel folding assistance system that operates on membrane proteins from the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . We show that folding of the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6 is promoted by ubiquitination of a specific lysine , retaining it in the ER while avoiding degradation', 'Subsequent ER exit requires removal of ubiquitin from this lysine by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP19 . This ubiquitination-deubiquitination is conceptually reminiscent of the glucosylation-deglucosylation occurring in the ER lumen during the calnexin/calreticulin folding cycle', 'To avoid infinite futile cycles , folded LRP6 molecules undergo palmitoylation and ER export , while unsuccessfully folded proteins are , with time , polyubiquitinated on other lysines and targeted to degradation', 'This ubiquitin-dependent folding system also controls the proteostasis of other membrane proteins as CFTR and anthrax toxin receptor 2 , two poor folders involved in severe human diseases . \\n While protein folding may be extremely efficient , the presence of multiple domains , in soluble or membrane proteins , greatly reduces the efficacy of the overall process', 'Thus , a set of enzymes and chaperones assist folding and ensure that a sufficient number of active molecules reach their final destination ( Brodsky and Skach , 2011; Ellgaard et al . , 2016 ) . Even with help , folding may remain inefficient and thereby sensitive to errors or mutations , leading to disease', 'An illustrative example of folding inefficiency , and the consequences thereof , is the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator ( CFTR ) , a chloride channel expressed at the surface of lung epithelial cells ( Riordan , 2008 ) . It has been estimated that less than 25% of newly synthesized CFTR molecules actually reach the plasma membrane', 'When the number of functional CFTR channels is further reduced , patients suffer from Cystic Fibrosis ( Riordan , 2008 ) . This is the case for mutations that affect the kinetics or thermodynamics of CFTR folding in the ER , such as the most frequent CF mutation ΔF508 , and which are recognized by ER quality control systems and targeted for degradation ( Riordan , 2008 )', 'Inefficiency in folding is a fairly common characteristic of transmembrane proteins ( Abrami et al . , 2008b; Deuquet et al . , 2009; Guerriero and Brodsky , 2012 ) . Most transmembrane proteins , which jointly compose 30% of the human proteome , are synthesized by ER-bound ribosomes and co-translationally inserted into the ER membrane ( Ellgaard et al . , 2016; Xu and Ng , 2015 )', 'Subsequent folding must proceed in three topological environments: the ER lumen , the membrane and the cytosol . In each of these environments , the protein may benefit from the help of chaperones and folding enzymes', 'On the luminal side , these are fairly well characterized and include HSP40 , HSP70 and HSP90 family members ( Brodsky and Skach , 2011 ) , the lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin ( Lamriben et al . , 2016 ) and protein disulfide isomerases ( Brodsky and Skach , 2011 ) . Less is known about the assisted folding in the ER membrane and on the cytosolic side', 'If folding or assembly in any of these environments fails , the protein is recognized by quality control machineries and targeted to the ER associated degradation ( ERAD ) pathway ( Lemus and Goder , 2014 ) . ERAD involves polyubiquitination of the cytosolic domains of transmembrane protein , extraction from the ER membrane and degradation by the proteasome ( Lemus and Goder , 2014 )', 'Here we have studied the biogenesis of Low-density lipoprotein Receptor-related Protein 6 ( LRP6 ) , a key component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway , which has been associated with many human pathologies including cancer , osteoporosis and metabolic diseases ( Joiner et al . , 2013 ) , but also involved in the formation of gap junctions in cardiomyocytes ( Li et al . , 2016 )', 'LRP6 is a type I membrane protein composed of a large extracellular domain containing multiple ß-propeller and EGF-like domains ( MacDonald et al . , 2009 ) . Proper folding of the ß-propeller domains depends of the dedicated LRP6 chaperone Mesd ( mesoderm development ) ( Hsieh et al . , 2003 ) and possibly other chaperones such as calnexin', 'We have previously shown that exit of LRP6 from the ER also requires a cytoplasmic post-translational modification , namely S-palmitoylation , on two cysteine residues in close proximity to the transmembrane domain ( Abrami et al . , 2008b )', 'LRP6 acylation influences the conformation of this domain , possibly by alleviating the hydrophobic mismatch between the thickness of the membrane and the length of the hydrophobic stretch composing the transmembrane domain . Mutation of the palmitoylation sites leads to retention of LRP6 in the ER and ubiquitination on Lys-1403 ( Abrami et al', ', 2008b ) indicative of its recognition by a quality control mechanism ( Feldman and van der Goot , 2009 ) . Once properly folded , LRP6 exits the ER , it transits through the Golgi , as indicated by the acquisition of Endoglycosidase H insensitive complex sugars ( Abrami et al . , 2008b ) , before reaching the plasma membrane where its signal role takes place', 'Here we have further investigated LRP6 biogenesis in the ER . We show that newly synthesized wild type LRP6 also undergoes ubiquitination , on the same site ( Lys-1403 ) , and that this post-translational modification promotes its folding . For ER exit to occur , ubiquitination must however be subsequently removed', 'This is mediated by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP19 , one of the isoforms of which is tail-anchored to the ER ( Hassink et al . , 2009; Wing , 2016 ) . It is thought to play an essential role in skeletal muscle atrophy through unclear mechanisms ( Wing , 2016 )', 'At the more mechanistic level , USP19 has been shown to control the stability of several cytoplasmic proteins such as the inhibitors of apoptosis c-IAP1 , and c-IAP2 ( Mei et al . , 2011 ) , hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha ( HIF-1α ) ( Altun et al . , 2012 ) and the initiator of autophagy Beclin1 ( Jin et al . , 2016 )', 'Interestingly , USP19 is a target gene of the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) and was found to rescue CFTR ΔF508 from ERAD ( Hassink et al . , 2009 ) . More recently it was found that USP19 is a key player in a novel misfolded-protein associated secretion MAPS pathway ( Lee et al . , 2016 ) . We show that USP19 controls the cellular levels of LRP6', 'In the absence of USP19 , LRP6 is efficiently targeted to ERAD . Upon USP19 overexpression , ER exit of LRP6 is greatly enhanced . This work reveals the existence of a novel assisted-folding system that operates on the cytosolic side of the ER and depends on site-specific cycles of ubiquitination-deubiquitination', 'Upon ubiquitination on Lys-1403 , LRP6 presumably interacts with an ubiquitin-binding protein that acts as a chaperone and provides the protein with time to fold . If folding is successful , LRP6 is transported out of the ER , a step that is favored by palmitoylation ( Abrami et al . , 2008b )', 'If folding is impaired or delayed , polyubiquitination of other cytosolic lysine residues takes over and targets LRP6 to ERAD', 'The here identified ubiquitination-deubiquitination assisted-folding cycle also appears to operate on other membrane proteins such as CFTR or the anthrax toxin receptor 2 ( also know as Capillary Morphogenesis gene 2 , CMG2 ) , loss of function of which leads to Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome ( Deuquet et al . , 2012 )', 'We analyzed LRP6 stability by performing a cycloheximide chase , which consists in following total protein expression levels by western blot analysis of extracts from Pigmented epithelial ( RPE1 ) cells submitted for various times to a protein synthesis block .

The involvement of lysosomal enzymes in LRP6 degradation thus requires export out of the ER', 'We have previously shown that LRP6 undergoes palmitoylation in the ER on Cys-1394 and Cys-1399 and that palmitoylation is required for ER exit ( Abrami et al . , 2008b ) .

Accelerated LRP6K1403R\\xa0degradation did not involve lysosomes since Bafilomycin A had no effect , also suggesting that newly synthesized LRP6K1403R does not significantly exit the ER during the 6 hr that follow its synthesis', 'Degradation of LRP6K1403R\\xa0could however be partially rescued by MG132 ( Figure 2C ) . Consistent with its targeting to the proteasome , LRP6K1403R\\xa0underwent polyubiquitination as revealed when immunoprecipitating LRP6 from MG132 treated cells and blotting against ubiquitin ( Figure 2D )', 'This observation also shows that ERAD targeting of LRP6 does not involve , or at least does not require , Lys-1403 polyubiquitination . Extending the pulse time to 2 or 16 hr revealed that the stability of LRP6 does depend on palmitoylation ( Figure 2E , F ) . The tripple LRP6K1403RCC−SS mutant was therefore the least stable ( Figure 2F )', 'Altogether these observations indicate that spontaneous folding of LRP6 is very inefficient , and that both ubiquitination and palmitoylation promote LRP6 biogenesis and ER exit . The process is however not all-or-none , i . e . even in the absence of Lys-1403 and/or palmitoylation , a small population of molecules folds properly and exits the ER', 'Pulse-chase experiments with long 35S pulses indeed reveal biphasic decay curves for all mutants studied , and show the existence , irrespective of the mutations , of a minor population of extremely long-lived molecules , which presumably reside at the plasma membrane . Importantly these constitute the steady state population that is revealed by western blotting', 'Western blot analysis of LRP6 mutants may therefore be misleading as to the importance of specific residues for biogenesis and membrane targeting ( Abrami et al . , 2008b ) . The above findings , combined with our previous observation that LRP6CC–SSundergoes ubiquitination on Lys-1403 and fails to exit the ER ( Abrami et al', ', 2008b ) , led us to propose the following working hypothesis: following synthesis and insertion into the ER membrane , LRP6 first undergoes ubiquitination , probably of a specific type , on Lys-1403 , allowing it to interact with an ER or cytosolic ubiquitin-binding protein', 'This interaction provides LRP6 with time to fold –and as such this ubiquitin-binding protein would act as a chaperone– protecting it from ERAD targeting . Lys-1403 is then deubiquitinated', 'At this stage , LRP6 can either ( 1 ) undergo palmitoylation of its two juxtamembranous cysteine residues , followed by ER exit , ( 2 ) be re-ubiquitinated on Lys-1403 , or ( 3 ) be polyubiquitinated on one of the other 16 cytoplasmic lysine residues and sent to ERAD', 'Option 1 , re-ubiquitination on Lys-1403 , allows LRP6 to undergo a second cycle of interaction with its ubiquitin-binding chaperone , further promoting folding . Palmitoylation , which favors ER exit ( Abrami et al . , 2008b ) , could prevent LRP6 from Lys-1403 ubiquitination , possibly through a conformational change of steric hindrance given the juxtamembrane localization of both modifications', 'A major prediction of this model is the existence of an ER localized deubiquitinating ( DUB ) enzyme that can remove ubiquitin specifically from Lys-1403 . This DUB would control LRP6 biogenesis . The human genome encodes some 100 DUBs ( Clague et al . , 2013 ) . Of these , the ubiquitin-specific proteases ( USPs ) represent the largest family with 56 members ( Ye , 2006 )', 'Because LRP6 folding takes place in the ER , we searched for ER-associated DUBs and to the best of our knowledge , only USP19 has an ER localized isoform ( Clague et al . , 2013; Hassink et al . , 2009; Wing , 2016 ) . Endogenous LRP6 and USP19 could be co-immunoprecipitated from RPE1 cells ( Figure 3A )', 'While ubiquitination of LRP6 is undetectable under control condition ( Figure 3A; see also Abrami et al . , 2008b ) , silencing of usp19 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) revealed a clear LRP6 ubiquitination signal ( Figure 3A ) , often , but not always , appearing as a well identifiable band and a smear', 'Strikingly , LRP6 levels dropped drastically upon usp19 silencing whether in HeLa ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) , RPE1 cells or primary human fibroblasts ( Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1C ) . The same was observed upon CRISPR/Cas9-mediated usp19 knockout in RPE1 cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B )', 'Silencing of usp19 also led to an increase in ubiquitination of palmitoylation-deficient LRP6CC–SS\\xa0and a decrease of its expression ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1D ) . In reverse , over expression of wild type USP19 , but not of its catalytically inactive mutant ( USP19C506S [Hassink et al', ', 2009] ) reduced ubiquitination of LRP6CC–SS ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1E ) , indicating that USP19 influences LRP6 ubiquitination in a manner that depends on its DUB activity .

Importantly , overexpression of catalytically inactive USP19C506S had no effect', 'This not only shows that the catalytic activity of USP19 is required , but the complete absence of rescue also indicates that USP19 does not act as a chaperone , as proposed for the unconventional misfolded protein-associated secretion MAPS pathway ( Lee et al . , 2016 )', 'The palmitoylation deficient LRP6CC–SS was affected in a qualitatively similar manner: silencing usp19 decreased t12app to less than 1 hr , while over expression of USP19 increased t12app to 6 hr ( Figure 3D ) . Remarkably , silencing or overexpression of USP19 had no effect whatsoever on LRP6K1403R ( Figure 3E )', 'Mutation of Lys-1403 similarly abolished the regulatory effect of USP19 on LRP6CC–SS , LRP6K1403RCC−SS being insensitive to the cellular USP19 levels ( Figure 3F ) . Altogether these experiments clearly point to Lys-1403 as the specific target site of USP19 , revealing the crucial role of this residue in preventing early LRP6 degradation', 'These experiments also show that USP19 , even when overexpressed , cannot reverse the polyubiquination undergone by LRP6K1403R and thus ERAD targeting , further highlighting the specificity of this DUB', 'Finally , these observations demonstrate that USP19 promotes the biogenesis of LRP6 , with only 18% of newly synthesized LRP6 molecules surviving beyond 6 hr in the absence of USP19 and 60% surviving upon USP19 overexpression .

More specifically we show that following synthesis , LRP6 undergoes ubiquitination on Lys-1403 , most likely of a specific form', 'In conceptual analogy to the binding of newly synthesized mono-glucosylated proteins to calnexin in the ER lumen ( Lamriben et al . , 2016 ) , we hypothesize that Lys-1403-ubiquitin can interact with a putative ER-ubiquitin binding protein that would also act as a chaperone . Upon release from this putative ubiquitin-binding chaperone , LRP6 is deubiquitinated by USP19', 'Following USP19 deubiquitination , LRP6 can , if properly folded , exit the ER , an events possibly promoted by palmitoylation of cysteines in the vicinity of Lys-1403 ( Abrami et al . , 2008b ) . Or , LRP6 can undergo a new cycle of Lys-1403-specific ubiquitination and chaperone binding', 'Upon prolonged presence in the ER , LRP6 undergoes polyubiquitination on other cytosolic lysines , leading to ERAD targeting . In the ER , LRP6 can thus undergo two types of ubiquitination events , which operate with different kinetics: ( 1 ) specific ubiquitination on Lys-1403 which promotes folding , ( 2 ) the slower polyubiquitination on other lysines which promotes ERAD', 'These two types of ubiquitination events are reminiscent of de-glucosidation and de-mannosidation of glycoproteins in the ER lumen , which also occur with different kinetics . De-glucosidation promotes folding of glycosylated protein , but if folding is too lengthy or fails , de-mannosidation takes place and targets the protein to ERAD', 'While the here described ubiquitin-dependent folding system was identified for LRP6 , it likely also operates on other membrane proteins . We indeed found that usp19 silencing also led to a pronounced decrease in the levels of CMG2 ( Figure 4D ) , defective folding of which lead to Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome ( OMIM #228600 ) ( Deuquet et al . , 2009 , 2011 )', 'Silencing of usp19 however did not affect the levels of the CMG2-related protein TEM8 ( Tumor endothelial marker 8 ) , nor those of the Transferrin and the EGF receptors ( Figure 4D ) . USP19 was reported to rescue the CFTR Δ508 mutant , which is an ERAD substrate ( Hassink et al . , 2009 ) . USP19 however also controls proteostasis of wild type CFTR ( Figure 4E )', 'Future studies are required to establish the generality of this ubiquitin-dependent folding system , determine whether it has a built-in quality control , and identify the missing components such as the folding-promoting ubiquitin ligase , the putative ubiquitin-binding chaperone and the degradation-targeting ligase ( Figure 4C )', 'All these enzymes could be exploited to control Wnt signaling in the context of disease . \\n Hela and RPE1 cells were used in this study .

Our results reveal how a membrane-bound retrotranslocase cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in membrane protein extraction', 'The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) is a major site for protein folding and maturation in the endomembrane system of the eukaryotic cell', 'A conserved quality control pathway called ER-associated protein degradation ( ERAD ) removes misfolded , unassembled and mistargeted proteins from the ER into the cytosol where they are degraded by the proteasome ( Christianson and Ye , 2014; Mehrtash and Hochstrasser , 2019; Ruggiano et al . , 2014 ) . ERAD thus contributes to protein homeostasis', 'Its malfunction results in ER stress ( Hwang and Qi , 2018 ) , and it has been linked to several human diseases ( Guerriero and Brodsky , 2012; Qi et al . , 2017 ) . ERAD is part of the ubiquitin proteasome system', 'Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified two universally conserved membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligases that ubiquitinate ERAD substrates , Hrd1 ( SYVN1 in human ) ( Bordallo et al . , 1998; Hampton et al . , 1996; Kikkert et al . , 2004; Nadav et al . , 2003 ) and Doa10 ( TEB-4/MARCH6 in animals , SUD-1 in Arabidopsis thaliana ) ( Doblas et al . , 2013; Hassink et al', ', 2005; Swanson et al . , 2001 ) . In higher eukaryotes , a larger variety of ubiquitin ligases plays a role in ERAD ( Olzmann et al . , 2013 ) . Substrates of ERAD can be soluble luminal proteins , or membrane proteins that either need to be moved across or extracted from the ER membrane', 'This process , termed retrotranslocation or dislocation , requires the AAA protein Cdc48 ( VCP or p97 in animals ) ( Bays et al . , 2001; Garza et al . , 2009; Jarosch et al . , 2002; Nakatsukasa et al . , 2008; Rabinovich et al . , 2002; Ye et al . , 2001 )', 'Cdc48 is recruited to substrates by its cofactors Ufd1 and Npl4 which interact with polyubiquitin chains with lysine 48 linkage ( Meyer et al . , 2002; Ye et al . , 2003 ) . The Cdc48 complex is thought to generate a pulling force that drives extraction of polyubiquitinated proteins from the membrane', 'This notion is based on biochemical experiments with soluble proteins ( Bodnar and Rapoport , 2017; Olszewski et al . , 2019 ) and recent cryo-EM structures ( Bodnar et al . , 2018; Cooney et al . , 2019; Twomey et al . , 2019 ) , which showed that processive threading of a substrate through the central pore of the Cdc48 hexamer under ATP consumption leads to unfolding', 'Apart from the Cdc48 ATPase , membrane proteins of the ERAD machinery are thought to contribute to retrotranslocation . For soluble substrates , Hrd1 forms part of a retrotranslocon pore from the ER lumen to the cytosol ( Baldridge and Rapoport , 2016; Carvalho et al . , 2010; Stein et al . , 2014; Vasic et al', ', 2020 ) , but other components such as the Derlin Der1 are also involved , as shown by biochemical data and a recent cryo-EM structure of the Hrd1 complex ( Mehnert et al . , 2014; Wu et al . , 2020 ) . Less is known about retrotranslocation of membrane proteins . The machinery that mediates this process needs to be quite versatile , because substrates can exhibit different topologies', 'They may contain one or multiple transmembrane ( TM ) segments , stretches of hydrophilic amino acids in luminal loops and tightly folded domains . How these structurally and physicochemically diverse elements move across a phospholipid bilayer during the extraction process is not known', 'Multipass transmembrane proteins such as members of the Derlin family ( Der1 and Dfm1 in yeast; Derlin-1 , –2 in animals ) , Hrd1 and Doa10 have been suggested to act as retrotranslocases for membrane proteins ( Carvalho et al . , 2010; Hampton and Sommer , 2012; Lilley and Ploegh , 2004; Neal et al . , 2018; Swanson et al . , 2001; Ye et al . , 2004 )', 'Another unresolved but linked question regards the folding state of luminal domains during the retrotranslocation process . It is unclear whether luminal domains are moved across the membrane in a folded state , if unfolding occurs prior to retrotranslocation , potentially by a separate ER luminal machinery , or if unfolding is directly coupled to retrotranslocation ( Brodsky , 2012; Shi et al', ', 2019 ) . To address these questions , we investigated ERAD mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 from S . cerevisiae . Doa10 is a 150 kDa protein with 14 TM segments ( Kreft et al . , 2006 ) . Its substrates include single- and multi-spanning membrane proteins of the ER and inner nuclear membrane , but also soluble proteins of the cyto- and nucleoplasm ( Ravid et al . , 2006 )', 'No completely soluble , luminal substrates of Doa10 have been described . The degrons of Doa10 substrates can be cytoplasmic ( Furth et al . , 2011; Swanson et al . , 2001 ) , or within the TM region ( Habeck et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , Doa10 regulates sterol metabolism in plants , fungi and animals by degrading squalene monooxygenase ( Doblas et al . , 2013; Foresti et al . , 2013 )', 'Through degradation of mislocalized membrane proteins , Doa10 has a role in maintaining organelle identity ( Dederer et al . , 2019; Matsumoto et al . , 2019; Ruggiano et al . , 2016 ) . Doa10 works in concert with two ubiquitin conjugating enzymes ( E2 ) , the tail-anchored membrane protein Ubc6 and the soluble cytoplasmic protein Ubc7 ( Swanson et al . , 2001 )', 'Ubc7 is anchored to the ER membrane by Cue1 ( Biederer et al . , 1997 ) . Experiments with soluble cytoplasmic protein fragments showed that Ubc6 and Ubc7 have different roles in the build-up of polyubiquitin chains . Ubc6 initiates ubiquitin chains by transferring the first ubiquitin moiety , whereas Ubc7 extends ubiquitin chains with mainly lysine 48 linkage ( Weber et al . , 2016 )', 'Importantly , Ubc6 is itself an unstable protein and degraded in a Doa10-dependent manner ( Swanson et al . , 2001; Walter et al . , 2001 ) . Similarly , Ubc6 homologues in plants and mammals have been shown to be unstable and are degraded by the proteasome ( Lam et al . , 2014 )', 'Interestingly , in case of the Arabidopsis thaliana Ubc6 homologue Ubc32 , and the mammalian Ube2J1 , Hrd1 was identified as the ubiquitin ligase involved ( Burr et al . , 2011; Chen et al . , 2016 ) . Here , we developed a reconstituted system with purified proteins to investigate the role of Doa10 in membrane protein retrotranslocation', 'This system allowed us to mechanistically investigate membrane protein extraction , without relying on indirect read-outs of downstream reactions such as proteasomal degradation . We show that Doa10 is a membrane protein retrotranslocase . Furthermore , we show how Doa10 cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in the extraction of proteins with folded luminal domains', 'We reconstituted purified and fluorescently labeled Doa10 and its substrate Ubc6 into separate liposome populations , together with complementary SNARE proteins ( Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 , A to F ) . The tail-anchored ( TA ) membrane protein Ubc6 was chosen as a model substrate , to limit the number of membrane proteins in our system and thus its complexity', 'To achieve efficient liposome fusion , we employed previously well-characterized engineered versions of rat SNAREs involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis ( Cypionka et al . , 2009; Hernandez et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , mixing of the two liposome sets led to SNARE-mediated co-reconstitution of Ubc6 and Doa10 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1G )', 'This approach ensures that Doa10 and Ubc6 only interact in the phospholipid bilayer , avoiding non-native interactions that can occur when membrane proteins are mixed in the presence of detergents for co-reconstitution . Protease protection experiments showed that Doa10 was reconstituted mostly in the correct orientation ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1H )', 'For Ubc6 , 45% was correctly oriented , another 45% wrong-side out oriented , and a minor fraction not properly membrane inserted ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 , I to K )', 'We postulated that retrotranslocase activity of Doa10 facilitates release of a substrate into the aqueous solution , but that such an event should be energetically disfavored unless the membrane-released state was stabilized by chaperones and re-insertion prevented ( Figure 1B ) . To test this hypothesis , we incubated Ubc6 liposomes with Get3 , a chaperone for TA proteins ( Mateja et al', ', 2009 ) that also interacts with Ubc6 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2A ) . Liposomes were then immobilized to separate soluble and membrane-bound proteins ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ) . In the presence of Get3 , 43 ± 4% Ubc6 was released from liposomes with co-reconstituted Doa10 ( Figure 1C , D and Figure 1—figure supplement 2C )', 'When co-reconstitution of Doa10 with Ubc6 was prevented by inhibiting SNARE-mediated fusion or when Ubc6 liposomes were fused with liposomes lacking Doa10 , only 7–9% of Ubc6 were found in the soluble fraction , representing the fraction of Ubc6 sticking to the outside of the liposome surface', 'In the absence of Get3 , or when we used a Get3 mutant defective in TA protein binding ( Get3 I193D ) ( Mateja et al . , 2009 ) , we observed no , or drastically reduced release , respectively . Nucleotide hydrolysis was not required for Ubc6 release and an ATPase deficient mutant ( Get3 D57N ) behaved indistinguishably from wild-type ( WT ) Get3', 'This suggests that Doa10 allows for passive movement of its substrate Ubc6 out of the membrane . Release of Ubc6 from the liposome membrane involves movement of the TM anchor and the luminally encapsulated C-terminus across the lipid bilayer . To directly measure exposure of the C-terminus upon retrotranslocation we used a Ubc6 variant labeled with an AlexaFluor488 ( A488 ) dye at the C-terminus', 'An anti-A488 antibody quenches A488 fluorescence and reports on accessibility of the C-terminus ( Figure 1E ) . In the absence of Doa10 , we observed a sudden decrease in fluorescence by 50% upon antibody addition , corresponding to the fraction of wrong-side out protein that exposes its C-terminus on the outside of liposomes', 'Upon solubilization of liposomes , the antibody quenches the fluorescence of all A488 epitopes . However , in the presence of Doa10 , the sudden decrease in fluorescence was followed by a slower decrease to about 10% of the original fluorescence signal within 30 min . Thus , in the presence of Doa10 , the luminally-encapsulated part of Ubc6 becomes accessible to the antibody over time', 'Ubc6 and Doa10 need to reside in the same membrane as we observed only minor quenching above background when we used a mutant SNARE that only supports liposome docking ( Figure 1E , F ) . As an alternative read-out for retrotranslocation , we used a protease protection assay . To identify correctly oriented Ubc6 we used an N-terminal SUMO fusion ( SUMO-Ubc6 ) and Ulp1 protease', 'To monitor retrotranslocation , we introduced a TEV protease cleavage site between the C-terminus of Ubc6 and the fluorescent dye . This cleavage site resides in the liposome lumen and would only become accessible upon retrotranslocation ( Figure 1G ) . Ulp1 incubation resulted in a shift of correctly oriented protein in SDS-PAGE', 'We then added TEV protease and followed cleavage over time ( Figure 1G , H ) . Wrong-side out SUMO-Ubc6 was completely accessible to TEV protease and\\xa0was cleaved independently of the presence of Doa10 within 5 min', 'Strikingly , only in the presence of Doa10 , Ulp1-cleaved , and thus right-side out Ubc6 was also accessible to TEV cleavage over longer incubation times , indicating retrotranslocation . In liposomes lacking Doa10 , only a small fraction of Ulp1-cleaved Ubc6 was accessible to TEV protease , corresponding to the not properly reconstituted Ubc6', 'Together , Get3 capture , antibody accessibility , and protease protection assays show that Doa10 facilitates movement of the Ubc6 TM across the membrane into the aqueous phase . Comparison of the fraction of correctly oriented protein and the released fraction shows that retrotranslocation is very efficient in all three assays . Thus , Doa10 is a retrotranslocase', 'Importantly , we also tested if another unrelated multipass membrane protein leads to Ubc6 retrotranslocation by destabilizing the lipid bilayer . To this end , we purified the TFoF1 ATP synthase from Bacillus PS3 , which contains 20 TM segments ( Guo et al . , 2019 )', 'Using the same reconstitution protocol as for Doa10 , we co-reconstituted ATP synthase with Ubc6 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A , B ) and then tested for retrotranslocation of Ubc6 using the antibody accessibility assay . Under these conditions , only a minor fraction of Ubc6 becomes accessible to the antibody ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3C , D )', 'We conclude that retrotranslocation of Ubc6 is not due to some non-specific perturbation of the membrane caused by any multipass TM protein . The observation that traps such as Get3 or the antibody are sufficient to drive retrotranslocation to completion suggests that Doa10 allows membrane-inserted and retrotranslocated soluble states of Ubc6 to exist in an equilibrium ( Figure 1B )', 'In the absence of Get3 or the anti-A488 antibody , the membrane-embedded state of the substrate is energetically favored . Get3 or the anti-A488 antibody shift the equilibrium towards the soluble state by binding to retrotranslocated Ubc6 . Thus , traps bind retrotranslocated Ubc6 and prevent reinsertion . In the cell , retrotranslocation requires Cdc48 activity ( Garza et al', ', 2009; Nakatsukasa et al . , 2008; Ye et al . , 2001 ) , suggesting that the pulling force generated by Cdc48 provides the directionality . To test this directly , we next investigated membrane extraction of Ubc6 by Cdc48 . As Cdc48 acts on polyubiquitin chains , we first reconstituted Ubc6 polyubiquitination', 'Degradation of Ubc6 requires its own E2 activity , the E2 Ubc7 and its adapter , the membrane-anchored Cue1 ( Biederer et al . , 1997; Swanson et al . , 2001; Walter et al . , 2001 ) . Using the fusion system , we co-reconstituted Doa10 and Cue1 with Ubc6', 'When we added ubiquitin activating enzyme ( E1 ) , ubiquitin , ATP , and Ubc7 , we observed robust polyubiquitination of Ubc6 ( complete reaction , Figure 2A ) . In the absence of Ubc7 or Cue1 , polyubiquitination was abolished , and we observed ubiquitin adducts of lower molecular weight ( Figure 2A , B )', 'These represent multiple monoubiquitinations , as the ubiquitination pattern was very similar when we used a ubiquitin mutant in which all lysines are mutated to arginine ( Ubiquitin K0 ) and that thus cannot form ubiquitin chains ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A )', 'Monoubiquitination also occurred in the absence of Doa10 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) , but was enhanced in its presence ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C , D ) . Kinetics of transfer of the first ubiquitin onto Ubc6 were independent of the presence of Ubc7/Cue1 ( Figure 2C ) , suggesting that monoubiquitination is a prerequisite for Ubc7-dependent polyubiquitination', 'This is indeed the case , as a catalytically inactive Ubc6 mutant ( Ubc6C87A ) was not ubiquitinated , but an N-terminal fusion of ubiquitin with inactive Ubc6 ( Ub-Ubc6C87A ) was a substrate for Ubc7-dependent polyubiquitination ( Figure 2D , E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1E )', 'Together , these results establish that after active site loading of Ubc6 with ubiquitin , Doa10 catalyzes Ubc6-monoubiquitination , followed by Ubc7/Cue1-dependent polyubiquitination ( Figure 2F ) . These results agree with observations made in intact cells and with recombinant soluble fragments of Doa10 and Ubc6 ( Walter et al . , 2001; Weber et al . , 2016 )', 'Furthermore , they indicate that our reconstituted system faithfully recapitulates the in vivo ubiquitination pathway for Ubc6 . Next , we tested for membrane extraction of polyubiquitinated Ubc6 by the Cdc48 ATPase', 'To this end , we immobilized Doa10/Ubc6 liposomes after the ubiquitination reaction , then incubated with Cdc48 and its co-factors Ufd1 and Npl4 ( UN ) , and analyzed soluble and membrane-bound fractions ( Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 , A to D ) . We observed Cdc48- and ubiquitination-dependent extraction of Ubc6 ( Figure 3A , B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1E , F )', 'Extraction efficiency was dependent on the length of ubiquitin chains , with five ubiquitin moieties being minimally required ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1G ) . In the presence of Cdc48/UN , 45 ± 17% of Ubc6 molecules with more than five attached ubiquitin moieties were extracted , compared to 15 ± 4% in the absence of the Cdc48 complex ( Figure 3A , C )', 'No extraction above this background was observed when either Cdc48 or Ufd1/Npl4 were omitted . Furthermore , ATP hydrolysis by the Cdc48 complex was necessary , as Cdc48E588A was inactive . Polyubiquitin chains were required because we found no extraction above background when ubiquitination was performed in the absence of Ubc7 or less than five ubiquitins were attached ( Figure 3A , C , D )', 'Similar observations were made when we used Ub-Ubc6C87A instead of WT Ubc6 to increase the efficiency of polyubiquitination ( Figure 3B , C ) . Together , these observations show that the Cdc48 complex provides the driving force for the extraction of a polyubiquitinated membrane protein . We currently do not understand what limits the efficiency of Cdc48 mediated extraction in our assay', 'It is possible that a stabilizing chaperone or an accessory factor such as the Cdc48 co-factor Ubx2 would contribute to complete extraction ( Neuber et al . , 2005; Schuberth and Buchberger , 2005 )', 'To define structural elements in Doa10 important for its retrotranslocase activity , we generated two truncated versions of Doa10 that encompassed either only the N-terminal RING domain and the first two TM segments ( Doa10-N ) , or the C-terminal part containing TM segments 3–14 ( Doa10-C ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 , F to H )', 'The sites of truncation were chosen based on the finding that in the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis , Doa10 is expressed as two separate polypeptides with similar boundaries ( Stuerner et al . , 2012 ) . We then tested if those Doa10 variants retrotranslocate Ubc6 using the antibody accessibility assay', 'Doa10-C behaved similarly to full-length Doa10 , whereas Doa10-N resulted in only minor quenching above background ( Figure 4A , B ) . Corresponding observations were made when we tested for retrotranslocation using the protease protection assay ( Figure 4C ) . These results show that TM segments 3–14 in Doa10 are sufficient to mediate retrotranslocation of Ubc6', 'To test for structural elements in Ubc6 relevant for retrotranslocation , we generated mutants in which either its TM anchor or its cytoplasmic part were replaced with the corresponding segments of the TA protein synaptobrevin ( Ubc6SybTM and SybUbc6TM , respectively )', 'We then tested for retrotranslocation of these mutants using the antibody accessibility assay ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A , B ) . We only observed retrotranslocation of the Ubc6 TM , but not of the Syb TM ( Figure 4D , E ) . A similar experimental setup also allowed us to exclude leakage or liposome rupture as the cause for antibody accessibility ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 , C to E )', 'Thus , the identity of the substrate’s TM segment is important for retrotranslocation . Next , we tested how these mutations in the TM domains of Doa10 and Ubc6 affect ubiquitination of Ubc6 . To specifically test for effects on polyubiquitination , we again used Ub-Ubc6C87A , for which the initial ubiquitination steps ( ubiquitin loading and monoubiquitination ) are bypassed', 'Replacement of the Ubc6 TM with the TM of Syb mildly affected polyubiquitination as seen by the emergence of shorter ubiquitin chains in the case of the Syb TM ( Figure 5A , B; Figure 5—figure supplement 1A , B ) . To test for effects of TM replacement on monoubiquitination of Ubc6 , we compared Ubc6 and Ubc6SybTM', 'Doa10-dependent monoubiquitination of Ubc6SybTM was impaired ( Figure 5C , D; Figure 5—figure supplement 1C , D ) , while E3-independent autoubiquitination of this mutant was unaffected ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1E , F ) . Thus , the Ubc6 TM anchor contributes to the efficient Doa10-dependent ubiquitination of Ubc6 , indicating a more efficient recruitment to Doa10', 'Moreover , efficient ubiquitination of Ubc6 requires the TM domain of Doa10 . Ubc6 polyubiquitination by Doa10-N was less efficient compared to full-length Doa10 ( Figure 5E , F ) . This was not due to impaired E3 activity , because co-reconstitution of Doa10-N and Doa10-C together restored ubiquitination to WT levels', 'Monoubiquitination in the absence of Ubc7 was similarly affected ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 , A to C ) . We conclude that the Doa10 region that includes TMs 3–14 plays a role in ubiquitination of Ubc6', 'Both ubiquitination and retrotranslocation of Ubc6 are sensitive to changes in the membrane-embedded regions of Ubc6 and Doa10 , indicating a specific interaction of Doa10 with the TM domain of Ubc6 . Previous observations suggested that the identity of the TM segment played a role in substrate degradation ( Habeck et al . , 2015; Ruggiano et al . , 2016; Walter et al . , 2001 )', 'Our results show that the TM domain of Doa10 recognizes substrates and thereby contributes to the specificity of substrate selection . The observation that the mutant version of Ubc6 ( Ubc6SybTM ) is still ubiquitinated to some extent suggests that other factors might contribute to substrate discrimination', 'Deubiquitinating enzymes have previously been shown to sharpen substrate selectivity in ERAD and might also play such a role in the context of Doa10-mediated ERAD ( Zhang et al . , 2013 ) . Substrates of Doa10 exhibit a wide range of topologies', 'They may contain multiple TM segments , such as the misfolded variants of the multi-spanning membrane proteins Pma1 and Ste6 , called Pma* and Ste6* , respectively ( Huyer et al . , 2004; Wang and Chang , 2003 ) , or luminal folded domains ( Vashist and Ng , 2004 )', 'We next asked the question how the presence of an additional luminal polypeptide segment or an interaction with another luminal protein affects retrotranslocation . We appended a streptavidin binding peptide ( SBP ) to the C-terminus of Ubc6 ( Ubc6-SBP ) , and formed a complex with streptavidin ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A , B )', 'When we co-reconstituted this complex with Doa10 , we observed no quenching over time upon antibody addition ( Figure 6A , B ) . When we added biotin , which breaks the high affinity SBP-streptavidin interaction ( Keefe et al . , 2001 ) , we observed Doa10-dependent quenching over time', 'This was only the case when biotin was used , but much reduced when we used a biotinylated protein , which is still capable of dissociating streptavidin from Ubc6-SBP on the outside of liposomes ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 , C to E ) , but cannot pass the membrane', 'Together , this shows that a protein-protein interaction on the luminal side of the membrane , mimicking the presence of a folded domain , acts as an anchor and prevents retrotranslocation of Ubc6 . Finally , we tested if this anchoring can be overcome by the Cdc48 complex', 'Liposomes containing Doa10 and Ubc6-SBP in complex with streptavidin were incubated with ubiquitination mix followed by the addition of Cdc48 complex and anti-A488 antibody . Retrotranslocation occurred depending on polyubiquitination and Cdc48 activity ( Figure 6C , D and Figure 6—figure supplement 1F )', 'In the absence of ubiquitin , when Ubc7 was omitted , or when we used the catalytically inactive Cdc48E588A , no fluorescence quenching above background was observed . Importantly , streptavidin remained encapsulated in liposomes in reactions where Ubc6-SBP was extracted ( Figure 6E , F )', 'Thus , Cdc48 action on the cytosolic side of the membrane leads to dissociation of streptavidin from the SBP-tag in the liposome lumen . As this reaction entails the breaking of bonds that are comparable to the intramolecular interactions that keep a protein folded , we interpret the dissociation of the SBP tag from streptavidin as unfolding', 'Our results thus show that Doa10 retrotranslocates a luminal protein segment in an unfolded state . Cdc48 , acting on cytoplasmic polyubiquitin chains , generates a mechanical force that results in luminal unfolding und drives retrotranslocation . The integrity of the membrane is maintained in this process', 'During extraction of a protein from the membrane , an energetic barrier must be overcome that depends on the hydrophobicity of its TM domain ( Botelho et al . , 2013; Guerriero et al . , 2017 ) . Our results provide evidence that Doa10 contributes to overcoming the energetic barrier for membrane protein extraction', 'This is demonstrated by passive movement of a tail-anchored membrane protein into the aqueous phase in the presence of Doa10 . In the absence of a folded luminal domain , factors such as Get3 or an antibody that trap the retrotranslocated state are sufficient to drive the reaction , bypassing the requirement for ubiquitination and Cdc48', 'ERAD also entails retrotranslocation of less hydrophobic sequences , such as those in luminal loops or domains , across the hydrophobic core of the membrane . We show that , once dissociated from streptavidin , a 57 amino acid long luminal protein segment that includes the SBP-tag is retrotranslocated by Doa10 without markedly affecting retrotranslocation kinetics', 'Thus , Doa10 can also accommodate these less hydrophobic sequences in the retrotranslocation process . A major unresolved question concerns the fate of luminal domains during retrotranslocation', 'Some studies suggested that luminal domains cross the ER membrane in a folded state , based either on the observation that substrates containing tightly folded domains were retrotranslocated in the first place or that they were detected in a folded state after retrotranslocation into the cytosol ( Fiebiger et al . , 2002; Petris et al . , 2014; Shi et al . , 2019; Tirosh et al . , 2003 )', 'Others suggested that retrotranslocation requires unfolding of luminal protein segments , including reduction of disulfide bonds , prior to retrotranslocation ( reviewed in Ellgaard et al . , 2018 ) . Some of these differences might be explained by the fact that different ubiquitin ligase complexes were involved that might have different requirements for retrotranslocation', 'Our data show that Doa10 does not accommodate a folded domain during retrotranslocation . Instead , unfolding of polypeptide segments on the luminal side of the membrane is a direct consequence of Cdc48 acting on cytoplasmically attached polyubiquitin chains . It is unclear if chaperone-driven retrotranslocation of Ubc6 in the absence of ubiquitination or Cdc48 action also occurs in the cell', 'Genetic and biochemical experiments in yeast showed that degradation of TM domain containing Doa10 substrates , including Ubc6 , strictly depends on Cdc48 , Ufd1 and Npl4 ( Foresti et al . , 2013; Habeck et al . , 2015; Huyer et al . , 2004; Neuber et al . , 2005; Ravid et al . , 2006; Ruggiano et al . , 2016; Wang and Chang , 2003 )', 'In the case of the strongly hydrophobic , multi-spanning Doa10 substrate Ste6* , fractionation experiments also showed that the Cdc48 complex is required for the retrotranslocation step ( Nakatsukasa et al . , 2008; Nakatsukasa and Kamura , 2016; Neal et al . , 2018 )', 'However , these experiments do not exclude the possibility that a relatively mildly hydrophobic protein such as Ubc6 retrotranslocates into the cytosol in a Doa10-dependent , but ubiquitination- and Cdc48-independent manner', 'Speculatively , such a chaperone-stabilized cytoplasmic pool would not be a substrate for proteasomal degradation but rather for chaperone-assisted reinsertion into the ER membrane , and might therefore be difficult to detect', 'Furthermore , as chaperones would only be able to capture a substrate that has emerged from the membrane , we expect such chaperone-driven retrotranslocation to be sensitive to the overall hydrophobicity of the TM segment . Interestingly , several studies showed that chaperones play an important role in ERAD of membrane proteins at different stages of the ERAD process', 'In yeast , Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperones promote ubiquitination of Ste6* and a misfolded variant of Pma1 ( Han et al . , 2007; Nakatsukasa et al . , 2008 ) . In mammals , the Bag6-Ubl4a-Trc35 chaperone complex facilitates ERAD of membrane proteins by stabilizing a soluble cytoplasmic state ( Claessen and Ploegh , 2011; Claessen et al . , 2014; Ernst et al . , 2011; Wang et al . , 2011; Xu et al', ', 2012 ) . If such chaperones also act as a sink in a putative Cdc48-independent retrotranslocation process , remains to be determined . Using a reconstituted system , we disentangled different ERAD subreactions , that\\xa0is substrate recruitment , ubiquitination , retrotranslocation , and membrane extraction . This allowed us to identify two activities of Doa10: retrotranslocase and ubiquitin ligase', 'The interplay of Doa10 and the Cdc48 complex during the extraction process remains to be further explored . Studies showed that Cdc48 is recruited to the Doa10-complex via Ubx2 ( Neuber et al . , 2005; Schuberth and Buchberger , 2005 )', 'This recruitment is dependent on the ubiquitination activity of Doa10 , suggesting that Cdc48-recruitment requires either autoubiquitination of Doa10 or substrate ubiquitination . Moreover , the Derlin Dfm1 , which also interacts with Cdc48 through its carboxy-terminal SHP-box , has been shown to be required for degradation of Ste6* ( Neal et al . , 2018 )', 'Our experimental system is expandable and can be used to explore how Dfm1 , Ubx2 or other factors affect retrotranslocation by Doa10 and Cdc48 . How exactly Doa10 facilitates release of proteins from the membrane is unclear . Structural information on Doa10 is necessary to further elucidate its mechanism of action', 'We speculate that TM segments access a binding site in Doa10 through a lateral gate . This might promote delipidation of TM segments and breaking of helix-helix interactions in multi-spanning membrane proteins . Quality control pathways for membrane proteins that require their extraction from the membrane exist not only in the ER , but also in other organelles', 'In the Golgi , mitochondria and chloroplasts , membrane proteins are removed from the organelle for proteasomal degradation in the cytosol . These processes are dependent on ubiquitination and Cdc48 ( Heo et al . , 2010; Ling et al . , 2019; Schmidt et al . , 2019; Tanaka et al . , 2010 )', 'Moreover , extraction of membrane proteins also occurs by membrane-bound AAA ATPases that often have not only unfolding , but also proteolytic activity . In mitochondria , Msp1 and the FtsH-related AAA metalloproteases m-AAA and i-AAA are examples for membrane-bound AAA ATPases ( Glynn , 2017 )', 'For m-AAA mediated extraction into the mitochondrial matrix , a contribution of the TM domain was shown , suggesting a retrotranslocase activity ( Korbel et al . , 2004; Lee et al . , 2017 ) . We propose that membrane-bound retrotranslocases generally contribute to AAA protein-driven extraction of membrane proteins . \\n For protein expression in E', 'coli , BL21-CodonPlus ( DE3 ) -RIPL competent cells ( Agilent ) were used .

The maturation of ER client proteins entails the chaperone assisted folding of nascent chains and assembly of functional complexes', 'Protein folding homeostasis in the ER requires that the complement of chaperones match closely the burden of nascent chains: too few chaperones risks misfolding and proteotoxicity ( Balch et al . , 2008 ) , whereas too many chaperones slow down folding , impede cell growth and incur a cost of excessive client protein degradation ( Dorner et al . , 1992; Feder et al . , 1992 )', 'The challenge in the ER is especially great , as the compartment experiences wide , physiologically-driven fluctuations in client protein load ( Itoh and Okamoto , 1980; Logothetopoulos and Jain , 1980 ) . But this dynamism also renders the ER a useful window into general principles that maintain protein folding homeostasis', 'The importance of transcriptional regulation of ER chaperone-encoding genes has long been recognized ( Chang et al . , 1989 ) and the signal transduction pathways that couple unfolded protein stress ( ER stress ) to gene expression—collectively referred to as the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) —have been worked out in some detail ( Walter and Ron , 2011 )', 'The inherent latency of this transcriptional program has favored the evolution of an additional strand to the UPR whereby , in animal cells , ER stress is coupled to rapid attenuation of protein synthesis ( Harding et al . , 1999 ) . Whilst translation attenuation is an effective bulwark against misfolding and proteotoxicity , it caps the biosynthetic yield on ER activity ( Trusina et al', ', 2008 ) . The inherent limitations and costs of the conventional transcriptional and translational UPR have generated interest in post-translational adaptations with shorter latency that rapidly match chaperone availability to client protein load', 'One such adaptation , apparently unique to the ER , is the reversible ADP ribosylation and de-ribosylation of the ER Hsp70 chaperone , BiP ( Carlsson and Lazarides , 1983 ) . In its ADP ribosylated form , BiP is locked into an inactive state with low affinity for its substrates ( Freiden et al . , 1992 )', \"ADP ribosylation affects residues in BiP that interfere with the allosteric coupling of ATP binding and hydrolysis in BiP's nucleotide binding domain ( NBD ) to the affinity of its substrate binding domain ( SBD ) for unfolded proteins ( Chambers et al . , 2012 ) , thus targeting the basic chaperoning mechanism used by all Hsp70/DnaK family members ( Mayer and Bukau , 2005 )\", 'A recent study reveals that the same circumstances that promote ADP ribosylation of BiP are also associated with rapidly reversible formation of an ester bond between threonine 366 in the NBD and adenosine monophosphate to yield BiP AMPylation , an inactivation modification ( Ham et al . , 2014 )', 'Whilst the interrelation of ADP ribosylation and AMPylation remain to be worked out , covalently modified BiP is understood to represent an inactive buffer that can be drawn upon in time of need , by removal of the modifications , thereby increasing the capacity of the ER to cope with enhanced unfolded protein burden whilst minimizing the cost of over-chaperoning', 'Indeed , the inter-conversion of ADP ribosylated and AMPylated BiP to the unmodified active form follows a coherent pattern whereby increased client protein load converts the inactive buffer form to the active one and diminished client protein load pushes modification the other way ( Laitusis et al . , 1999; Ham et al . , 2014; Sanyal et al . , 2015 )', 'The transitions noted above occur over a time scale of ∼1 hr , allowing for more rapid adaptations . One such potential adaptation entails oligomerization .

In recent years it has become apparent that the highly conserved interdomain linker connecting the NBD and SBD plays a crucial role in allosteric regulation of Hsp70 proteins ( Swain et al . , 2007; Kityk et al . , 2012; Qi et al . , 2013 )', 'Specifically , the aliphatic side chains of the conserved linker are reversibly buried against the NBD ( in the ATP-bound state of the chaperone ) or exposed to the solvent ( in the ADP-bound state ) mediating key allosteric transitions ( Bertelsen et al . , 2009; Kumar et al . , 2011 )', 'Here we report on application of a chemical probe specific to the interdomain linker of BiP and site-specific crosslinking to analyze its disposition in BiP monomers and oligomers .

In the ATP-bound state the two domains are in close juxtaposition and the side-chains of the hydrophobic interdomain linker are engaged at the interface of the NBD and SBD ( Liu and Hendrickson , 2007; Kumar et al . , 2011; Kityk et al . , 2012; Qi et al', ', 2013 ) , whereas in the ADP-bound state the domains are uncoupled and the interdomain linker is exposed to the solvent ( Swain et al . , 2007; Bertelsen et al . , 2009 )', 'It therefore came as surprise to find that in vitro hydrolysis of the ATP in cell lysates ( and its conversion to ADP ) left a substantial fraction of BiP protected from digestion by a specific protease ( SubA ) that cleaves its interdomain linker ( Paton et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 1A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 08961 . 003Figure 1 .

Together , these observations establish a negative correlation between BiP oligomerization and client binding', 'BiP oligomers were observed here to form by engagement of the hydrophobic interdomain linker of one BiP protomer as a typical substrate of an adjacent BiP protomer', \"This process , revealed by monitoring the accessibility of BiP's interdomain linker to a sequence-specific protease , SubA , and by site-specific crosslinking , is conspicuous in preparations of pure proteins in vitro , and in living cells\", 'BiP oligomerization is rapidly tuned to the physiological state of the cell , and given that oligomerization inactivates participating BiP protomers , the oligomeric form is a relatively inactive storage form of the chaperone that is accessible on a short time scale', 'Our findings are consistent with a model whereby competition between oligomerization and substrate binding buffers the ER against rapid fluctuations in unfolded protein load in both directions . The interdomain linker of Hsp70 chaperones consists of a short stretch of aliphatic residues , well suited to engage the SBD ( Flynn et al . , 1989; Blond-Elguindi et al . , 1993 )', 'A crystal form of bacterial DnaK with cross-protomer binding of the interdomain linker in the SBD shows the engagement of two highly conserved aliphatic side chains of the linker in hydrophobic sites of the SBD ( Chang et al . , 2008 )', 'Given the role of these very same side chains in allosteric coupling between the NBD and SBD , this mode of BiP oligomerization results in removal of the BiP protomers involved from the pool of active chaperones', 'The proposed architecture of the oligomers ( Figure 1C ) fits well with our finding of a single peptide binding site available in BiP oligomers formed in vitro , regardless of their size ( Figure 2F ) . The model fits the observation that oligomeric forms of Hsp70 are holdases rather than foldases ( Blond-Elguindi et al . , 1993; Thompson et al', ', 2012 ) , as the only protomer capable of engaging substrate ( protomer A , Figure 1C ) is allosterically uncoupled by the engagement of its interdomain linker in the SBD of the adjacent protomer . The model also explains the observation that DnaK oligomers formed in vitro are subject to regulation by the nucleotide exchange factor , GrpE ( Thompson et al', ', 2012 ) , as the last protomer ( protomer C , Figure 1C ) is predicted to retain the capacity to respond allosterically to ATP binding to its NDB , initiating oligomer disassembly . Our in vitro experiments provide a crude guide to the stability of BiP oligomers . In the absence of ATP , oligomers appear to be remarkably stable with a dissociation K1/2max in the lower micromolar range', 'In vivo , oligomer assembly and disassembly is likely to be influenced by co-chaperones of the DnaJ family that enhance ATP hydrolysis to promote the high affinity state and exchange factors , such as GRP170 and SIL1 , that convert BiP to the low affinity state by exchanging ADP for ATP', 'These co-factors are likely to have an important role in the kinetics of the inter-conversion of BiP monomers to oligomers and in the competing processes of substrate binding and release . Nonetheless , the high concentration of BiP in the ER ( >200 µM , [Ghaemmaghami et al', ', 2003] ) and the inherent affinity of BiP protomers for one another , are consistent with a model whereby oligomerization and substrate binding compete with each other on a level playing field', 'Exploring the relationship between unfolded protein load and the oligomeric state of Hsp70 chaperones is confounded by powerful feedback that dominates the unfolded protein responses and couples chaperone production to the levels of unfolded protein stress', 'To explicitly cope with this methodological limitation , we have confined the analysis to the early stages of the perturbations that increase the unfolded protein load in the ER and employed manipulations , such as reduction of disulfide bonds by DTT , that are effective even in the absence of ongoing protein synthesis', 'Our observations paint a coherent picture whereby enhanced production of unfolded proteins rapidly draws on the pool of inactive , oligomeric BiP to service its growing clientele', 'Reports of enhanced presence of oligomers in longer-term stressed cells may have reflected the partitioning of excess chaperone produced during the activated UPR ( or its cytoplasmic counterpart , the heat shock response ) but made redundant following resolution of the insult ( Freiden et al . , 1992; Thompson et al . , 2012 )', 'Furthermore , activation of parallel chaperones , such as the oxidative stress induced Hsp33 of bacteria , may account for regulated redundancy of the Hsp70/DnaK system , favoring oligomerization through linker engagement in the course of certain stress responses ( Winter and Jakob , 2004 )', 'The ER is unusual in possessing alternative mechanisms for inactivating its Hsp70 protein , BiP , by covalent modification ( ADP ribosylation ) ( Freiden et al . , 1992; Laitusis et al . , 1999; Chambers et al . , 2012 ) and AMPylation ( Ham et al . , 2014 ) . The modified form of BiP appears to equilibrate with the active pool more slowly than the oligomers', 'Together , our observations suggest a hierarchical post-translational mechanism for maintaining balance between chaperones and their clients in the highly dynamic ER ( Figure 12 ) . The first line of buffering consists of oligomer formation , as the balance between chaperones and clients tips in favor of the former , and oligomer dissolution , as the balance tips the other way', 'Conversion of BiP to the modified , inactive form proceeds on a longer time scale . Its precise relationship to oligomerization is unclear , as both the unemployed monomer and inactive oligomer , could , in theory , serve as substrates for the modification ( s )', 'Either way it seems likely that the physiological impact of both oligomerization and modification is to enable the cell to avoid the cost of over-chaperoning ( Dorner et al . , 1992; Feder et al', ', 1992 ) without having to degrade surplus BiP as stress is resolved and to provide cells with an inactive reserve of BiP to draw upon as stress mounts , without resorting to activation of the translational and transcriptional arms of the UPR . 10 . 7554/eLife . 08961 . 025Figure 12 .

With diminishing clients it partitions to inactive oligomers , with whom it exists in equilibrium . This equilibrium is influenced by ER calcium , whose depletion favors the oligomeric form', 'The ‘A’ form is also in equilibrium with modified BiP ( ‘B’ form , likely ADP-ribosylated or AMPylated BiP ) and this equilibrium too is influenced by unfolded protein burden but on a slower time scale than oligomer formation and disassembly . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 08961', '025 Our analysis has been confined to the ER , where the balance between chaperones and clients fluctuates widely according to the physiological state of the cell and is relatively easy to manipulate pharmacologically . But oligomerization can serve as an intrinsic mechanism to inactivate excess Hsp70 in other compartments of the eukaryotic cell and indeed across phyla', 'In that sense oligomerization would appear to be a common primitive strand of the post-translational UPR , recruiting and inactivating Hsp70 chaperones according to need . This simple , mass action-based mechanism for regulating Hsp70 function may exist alongside other mechanisms , such as oxidation-induced domain unfolding , which may promote alternative modes of oligomerization ( Winter et al', ', 2005 ) . Such alternative modes may account for the heterogeneity of DnaK oligomers observed by single particle electron microscopy ( Thompson et al . , 2012 ) . The inverse correlation between unfolded protein burden and BiP oligomerization appears to break down in the context of ER calcium depletion , which is both a strong inducer of the UPR and promotes rapid oligomerization of BiP', 'This apparent paradox needs to be considered in the context of observations that BiP oligomerization upon calcium depletion also correlates with less substrate binding ( a feature first noted many years ago [Suzuki et al . , 1991] and confirmed here ) and with the observation that calcium depletion-mediated oligomerization slowly draws on the modified , inactive pool of BiP', \"From BiP's perspective , oligomerization appears to be the primary event triggered by ER calcium efflux . This depletes the pool of active chaperones and disrupts , by mass action , chaperone-client interactions , releasing clients that would otherwise have remained bound to BiP\", 'The ensuing , slower loss of the modified form of BiP is consistent with equilibrium between the modified form and the monomer and its latency is consistent with the need for enzymes to remove the modifications . We do not understand how calcium depletion shifts the equilibrium in favor of the oligomer', 'In vitro , there is no measureable effect of calcium on BiP oligomerization , in either the ATP state or ADP state or in the presence of the J-factor ERdj3 or the exchange factor GRP170 ( not shown ) , yet in vivo , ER calcium depletion promotes such oligomerization', 'This discrepancy could be resolved by an ER-localized J-factor whose affinity for BiP as a substrate is increased selectively as ( Ca+2 ) ER declines', 'Given that the affinity of Hsp70 proteins for their substrates is governed by J-protein driven non-equilibrium mechanisms ( De Los Rios and Barducci , 2014 ) , such a scenario could account for BiP favoring itself as a client ( oligomerizing ) over other clients , as ( Ca+2 ) ER declines', 'Regardless of mechanism , one consequence of ( Ca+2 ) ER depletion-mediated BiP oligomerization would be to also shift the equilibrium between unfolded proteins and active chaperones in favor of the former . Furthermore , given the 1:1 stoichiometry of the repressive complex formed between BiP and the lumenal , stress-sensing domains of the UPR transducers PERK and IRE1 ( Bertolotti et al', ', 2000 ) , it seems likely that the monomer serves as a UPR repressor . Thus , ( Ca+2 ) ER depletion-mediated oligomerization of BiP stands to contribute to UPR activation by increasing the burden of free unfolded proteins and by lowering the availability of monomeric BiP to repress the stress transducers', 'Calcium depletion-mediated oligomerization of BiP is observed in physiological circumstances , as a consequence of engagement of cell surface receptors by activating ligands that couple to store release channels . We do not know if oligomerization of BiP and its downstream consequences are a feature that promotes fitness ( i . e', 'a feature that has been positively selected during eukaryote evolution ) or simply a reflection of limitations in the functionality of an organelle that experiences fluctuations in the concentration of calcium , imposed by other exigencies , such as the benefits of signaling in the cytosol by the released calcium', 'However , it is tempting to speculate that the transient excursions of UPR signaling imposed by BiP oligomerization may have some benefit . In secretory cells , such a scheme would couple signals that promote granule secretion to transient translational repression ( attendant upon PERK activation [Harding et al . , 1999] )', 'This may have short-term benefits in terms of diverting resources away from translation to the bio-energetically costly process of secretion . Transient activation of UPR transducers also results in elaboration of downstream effectors . These transcription factors , XBP1 , ATF6 and ATF4 , adapt cells to their secretory mission by promoting the latent process of ER biogenesis ( Sriburi et al', ', 2004; Lee et al . , 2005 ) , and by expanding the capacity to translate mRNAs ( Harding et al . , 2003 )', 'It is thus tempting to speculate that calcium depletion-mediated BiP oligomerization contributes to transient activation of the UPR observed in secretory cells responding to secretagogues ( Kubisch and Logsdon , 2007 ) and thereby promotes long-term coupling of the capacity to produce and process precursors of secretory proteins to the short-term demand for the secreted end product', 'Supplementary file 1 lists the plasmids used , their lab names , description and notes their first appearance in the figures and the corresponding label , and provides a past reference , where available', 'Wildtype and mutant versions of N-terminally hexahistidine- ( His6- ) tagged hamster BiP ( see Supplementary file 1 and ‘Plasmid construction’ ) were encoded on pQE10 plasmids ( Qiagen UK , Manchester , United Kingdom ) and expressed in M15 E . coli cells ( Qiagen ) as described previously ( Chambers et al . , 2012 )', 'In brief , bacterial cultures were grown at 37°C in LB medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 50 µg/ml kanamycin to an optical density ( OD600 nm ) of 0 . 8 and expression was induced with 1 mM isopropylthio β-D-1-galactopyranoside ( IPTG )', 'After incubation for 6 hr at 37°C the cells were sedimented by centrifugation and pellets were lysed using a high-pressure homogenizer ( EmulsiFlex-C3; Avestin ) in buffer A [50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 0', '2% ( vol/vol ) Triton X-100 , 10% ( vol/vol ) glycerol , 20 mM imidazole] supplemented with protease inhibitors ( 2 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) , 4 µg/ml pepstatin , 4 µg/ml leupeptin , 8 µg/ml aprotinin ) and 0 . 1 mg/ml DNaseI', 'The lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 25 , 000 g and incubated with 1 ml Ni-NTA agarose ( Quiagen ) per 1 L of expression culture for 2 hr at 4°C .

      "\t ['Maintaining the essential functions of mitochondria requires mechanisms to recognize and remove misfolded proteins . However , quality control ( QC ) pathways for misfolded mitochondrial proteins remain poorly defined . Here , we establish temperature-sensitive ( ts- ) peripheral mitochondrial outer membrane ( MOM ) proteins as novel model QC substrates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'The ts- proteins sen2-1HAts and sam35-2HAts are degraded from the MOM by the ubiquitin-proteasome system . Ubiquitination of sen2-1HAts is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase ( E3 ) Ubr1 , while sam35-2HAts is ubiquitinated primarily by San1', 'Mitochondria-associated degradation ( MAD ) of both substrates requires the SSA family of Hsp70s and the Hsp40 Sis1 , providing the first evidence for chaperone involvement in MAD . In addition to a role for the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex , Doa1 and a mitochondrial pool of the transmembrane Cdc48 adaptor , Ubx2 , are implicated in their degradation', 'This study reveals a unique QC pathway comprised of a combination of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors that distinguish it from other cellular QC pathways . \\n Proper protein folding is essential for organelle and cell homeostasis', 'Proteins may fail to achieve or retain their functional conformations due to genetic or environmental insults and cells have evolved elaborate protein quality control ( QC ) mechanisms to combat misfolding . QC systems recognize and refold misfolded proteins and , when not possible , sequester or degrade them to prevent their often deleterious accumulation ( Kevei et al . , 2017 )', 'Such degradation frequently occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasome system ( UPS ) , where substrates are modified with ubiquitin leading to their destruction by the 26S proteasome ( Metzger et al . , 2012 )', 'Ubiquitin modification requires the action of ubiquitin-activating enzyme ( E1 ) , followed by either sequential or concerted activity of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes ( E2 ) and substrate-specific ubiquitin ligases ( E3 ) . Multiple rounds of ubiquitination result in polyubiquitin chains , which can serve as targeting signals for recognition and degradation by 26S proteasomes ( Akutsu et al', ', 2016; Thrower et al . , 2000 ) . Other classes of factors play critical roles in substrate recognition and in their extraction from associated proteins or membranes post-ubiquitination , as well as in shuttling to proteasomes ( Buchberger et al . , 2015; Ye et al . , 2017; Zientara-Rytter and Subramani , 2019 )', 'Distinct , yet overlapping UPS machinery found at different subcellular locations mediates localized QC of misfolded proteins ( Sontag et al . , 2017 ) . The degradation of misfolded proteins at the ribosome , endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , nucleus , inner nuclear envelope , and cytosol is mediated by dedicated UPS machinery ( Boban and Foisner , 2016; Brandman and Hegde , 2016; Comyn et al', ', 2014; Gamerdinger , 2016; Jones and Gardner , 2016; Zattas and Hochstrasser , 2015 ) . Much of what is known about these subcellular QC pathways was uncovered in yeast using model misfolded substrates ( Bays et al . , 2001; Gardner et al . , 2005; Huyer et al . , 2004; Stolz and Wolf , 2012; Vashist and Ng , 2004 ) and has served as the basis for characterizing mammalian degradation pathways', 'The most extensively studied organelle-based QC pathway is ER-associated degradation ( ERAD ) . Early steps in ERAD pathways , such as substrate recognition and ubiquitination , are distinct for different substrates and defined ( at least in yeast ) by the location of the misfolded domain ( Carvalho et al . , 2006; Huyer et al . , 2004; Preston and Brodsky , 2017; Ruggiano et al . , 2014 )', 'Generally , pathways converge post-ubiquitination , where the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex and its associated co-factors facilitate unfolding and/or extraction of substrates from their natural environments prior to targeting to 26S proteasomes for degradation ( Olszewski et al . , 2019; Wolf and Stolz , 2012 )', 'Mitochondrial proteins are subject to ongoing oxidative insults that can result in damage , misfolding , and dysfunction . Mitochondria require mechanisms to eliminate these proteins to maintain organellar integrity and essential functions ( Voos et al . , 2016 )', 'In mammalian cells , the well-characterized Parkin and PINK1 ubiquitin-dependent mitophagy pathway removes portions of , or entire , damaged mitochondria ( McWilliams and Muqit , 2017; Pickles et al . , 2018 ) . In yeast , however , mitophagy appears to function primarily to adapt to metabolic changes , rather than in protein QC ( Fukuda and Kanki , 2018; Kanki et al . , 2015 )', 'Furthermore , there is little evidence indicating that mitophagy is ubiquitin-dependent , in accordance with the absence of obvious yeast orthologues of Parkin or PINK1 ( Belgareh-Touzé et al . , 2017; Tan et al . , 2016 )', 'In contrast to mitophagy , mitochondria-associated degradation ( MAD ) pathways for individual misfolded or damaged mitochondrial proteins are not as well-established in mammals or yeast . Proteases resident to the mitochondrial matrix , inner membrane ( IM ) , and intermembrane space ( IMS ) can act on damaged or aggregated proteins in these compartments ( Bohovych et al . , 2015 )', 'While there is no evidence for proteasomes inside mitochondria , the mitochondrial outer membrane ( MOM ) is fully accessible to cytosolic proteasomes', 'In fact , the UPS is known to play a critical role in mitochondrial morphology , dynamics , inheritance , and in the degradation of import-deficient mitochondrial IMS proteins and mitochondria-mislocalized tail-anchored proteins ( Altmann and Westermann , 2005; Bragoszewski et al . , 2017; Cohen et al . , 2008; Fisk and Yaffe , 1999; Goodrum et al . , 2019; Matsumoto et al . , 2019; Rinaldi et al', ', 2008 ) . A limited number of MOM proteins have also been identified as specific UPS targets in yeast: Fzo1 , Mdm12 , Mdm34 , Msp1 , and Tom70 ( Belgareh-Touzé et al . , 2017; Cohen et al . , 2008; Fritz et al . , 2003; Ota et al . , 2008; Wu et al . , 2016 ) . All of these are native ( i . e', 'non-misfolded ) proteins , whose ubiquitination and/or degradation may be critical for homeostasis and not obviously related to QC . Of these , only Fzo1 has been examined in detail', 'The regulated recognition\\xa0and\\xa0ubiquitination of this mitofusin by SCFMdm30 ( Skp1-Cullin-F-box E3 with F-box protein Mdm30 ) and its subsequent proteasomal degradation are integral to the process of MOM fusion ( Cohen et al . , 2011; Cohen et al . , 2008; Escobar-Henriques et al . , 2006 )', 'However , for the few other MOM proteins where ubiquitination has been analyzed , the E3 Rsp5 has been implicated ( Belgareh-Touzé et al . , 2017; Goodrum et al . , 2019; Kowalski et al . , 2018; Wu et al . , 2016 ) . The involvement of Cdc48 co-factors , Vms1 and Doa1 , has also been both reported and disputed for particular MOM proteins ( Chowdhury et al', ', 2018; Esaki and Ogura , 2012; Heo et al . , 2010; Wu et al . , 2016 ) . The degradation of tail-anchored proteins mislocalized to the MOM uniquely requires the AAA-ATPase Msp1 for extraction from the MOM prior to transfer to the ER where they are degraded by ERAD machinery ( Matsumoto et al . , 2019; Okreglak and Walter , 2014; Wohlever et al . , 2017 )', 'Thus , a universal MAD pathway for MOM proteins has not been described and many steps in substrate degradation remain unexamined . Similarly , UPS components acting on misfolded MOM proteins have yet to be investigated . In this study , we establish temperature-sensitive ( ts- ) peripheral MOM proteins ( sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts ) as QC substrates', 'The ts- nature of these substrates , coupled with their tight association with the MOM , enabled study of their mitochondrial degradation without concerns of mislocalization to the cytosol or elsewhere . We utilize these substrates to define a MAD pathway for non-native proteins', 'The proteasomal degradation of these MAD QC substrates occurs at the MOM and requires specific cytosolic and mitochondrial UPS components , most of which are conserved in higher eukaryotes . Our results reveal a requirement for factors not previously implicated in the degradation of native MAD substrates and the combination of components identified defines a distinct QC pathway', 'Our knowledge of protein QC in the ER , cytosol , and nucleus derives in part from the study of proteins that undergo temperature-dependent misfolding and degradation ( Biederer et al . , 1996; Gardner et al . , 2005; Khosrow-Khavar et al . , 2012; Ravid et al . , 2006; Wang and Prelich , 2009 )', 'To elucidate how misfolded mitochondrial proteins are targeted for destruction , we exploited two previously-identified yeast ts- alleles , sam35-2 and sen2-1 ( Li et al . , 2011; Milenkovic et al . , 2004; Winey and Culbertson , 1988 ) , whose degradation has not been assessed . Sam35 and Sen2 are essential MOM proteins', 'Sam35 is the substrate receptor of the MOM-embedded multiprotein sorting and assembly machinery ( SAM ) complex required for assembly of β-barrel proteins into the MOM ( Chan and Lithgow , 2008; Kozjak et al . , 2003; Kutik et al . , 2008; Milenkovic et al . , 2004 ) . Although Sam35 contains no apparent membrane spans , it is tightly embedded at the MOM via the Sam50 protein ( Kutik et al', ', 2008 ) . Sen2 provides endonuclease activity for the multi-subunit tRNA splicing endonuclease complex and also cleaves a mitochondria-targeted non-stop mRNA ( Ho et al . , 1990; Tsuboi et al . , 2015; Winey and Culbertson , 1988 ) . The tRNA splicing complex resides on the MOM in yeast , with Sen2 potentially anchoring it to the membrane via a hydrophobic segment ( Trotta et al', ', 1997; Yoshihisa et al . , 2003 ) . We first determined that sam35-2ts and sen2-1ts encoded full-length proteins . Each contained multiple missense mutations ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) that likely account for the phenotypes reported ( Li et al . , 2011; Milenkovic et al . , 2004; Winey and Culbertson , 1988 )', 'To facilitate detection , sequence encoding an HA tag was added to the C-terminus of each to generate sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts . Genome-integrated versions of sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts support cell viability at the permissive ( 25°C ) but not non-permissive temperature ( 37°C; Figure 1A ) , consistent with the previously-described untagged versions ( Li et al . , 2011; Milenkovic et al', ', 2004; Winey and Culbertson , 1988 ) . To determine whether their ts- phenotypes are indicative of protein misfolding that may lead to instability , we assessed sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts turnover by cycloheximide ( CHX ) chase when expressed from centromeric ( CEN ) yeast plasmids', 'Cells were grown at 25°C until the addition of CHX at time ‘zero’ , when the temperature was either maintained at 25°C or raised to 37°C . The addition of CHX prior to raising the temperature minimizes the contribution of newly synthesized ts- proteins that may misfold prior to reaching the mitochondria', 'We find that increasing the temperature to 37°C results in dramatic destabilization of the ts- proteins relative to the WT proteins ( Figure 1B ) . Chromosomal versions behaved similarly ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) . Thus , the ts- nature of these alleles is likely attributable to misfolding leading to destabilization at the non-permissive temperature', 'Next , agarose-embedded cells expressing GFP-tagged sam35-2ts and sen2-1ts were used to assess whether these non-transmembrane MOM proteins remain mitochondrially-associated following the increase to the non-permissive temperature', 'For this , the temperature was raised to 37°C for 5 min ( sen2-1GFPts ) or 15 min ( sam35-2GFPts ) , times at which sam35-2GFPts and sen2-1GFPts were already destabilized by CHX chase ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C )', 'Co-expression of sam35-2GFPts and sen2-1GFPts with a mitochondrial marker ( mtRFP ) demonstrated that the ts- proteins remain mitochondrial after the temperature increase ( Figure 1C ) . To bypass difficulties associated with imaging these low abundance ts- proteins , we isolated mitochondria by subcellular fractionation and assessed the localization of destabilized sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts', 'Using the same conditions as for microscopy , we found that the HA-tagged ts- proteins are destabilized upon the addition of CHX ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1D ) and that protein turnover was still evident in the spheroplasted yeast used for fractionation ( WT; Figure 1—figure supplement 1E )', 'Consistent with our microscopy , sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts fractionated almost exclusively to the mitochondrial pellet at 37°C ( P; Figure 1D ) . A similar fractionation pattern was observed with chromosomal HA-tagged ts- alleles ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1F )', 'Therefore , sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts are destabilized at the non-permissive temperature yet remain mitochondrially-localized , validating their use as model MAD QC substrates . Since proteasomes have broad roles in mitochondrial homeostasis and morphology , we assessed whether the degradation of these MOM ts- proteins was dependent on proteasome function', 'The turnover of sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts was assessed at the non-permissive temperature in strains containing conditional mutations in the 20S core ( pre1-1 pre2-2; Figure 2A ) or the 19S cap ( cim3-1; Figure 2B ) of the 26S proteasome . Both ts- proteins were substantially stabilized in these mutants relative to isogenic WT strains', 'In contrast , vacuolar or mitochondrial resident proteases were not required for sam35-2HAts or sen2-1HAts turnover ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B )', 'After establishing that the stabilization of the ts- proteins in pre1-1 pre2-2 spheroplasts mirrors that observed in intact cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1E ) , we assessed whether sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts remain mitochondrial when proteasome function is impaired', 'Even after 40 min at the non-permissive temperature , the majority of both sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts accumulated in the 12 , 000xg mitochondrial pellet ( Figure 2C ) . Extraction of both proteins from this pellet fraction by sodium carbonate excluded the possibility that this represents aggregated protein ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C )', 'This crude mitochondrial pellet also contains\\xa0~20% of total ER as assessed by measuring levels of the integral ER membrane protein Cue1 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1D ) . For this reason , we wished to exclude the possibility that these substrates were being translocated to the ER for degradation', 'Such a pathway has recently been described for tail-anchored proteins that are mislocalized to mitochondria ( Matsumoto et al . , 2019 )', 'Further purification of the crude 12 , 000xg mitochondrial pellet isolated from pre1-1 pre2-2 cells via sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation removes\\xa0~90% of contaminating ER , leaving only\\xa0~2% of total ER in these purified mitochondria ( Cue1; Figure 2—figure supplement 1E ) . On the other hand , this purified mitochondrial fraction retains\\xa0~70% of the ts- proteins', 'As peripheral membrane proteins could dissociate from mitochondria during manipulation , 70% may be an underrepresentation of the mitochondria-associated pool in vivo . Thus , these data indicate that sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts primarily accumulate at the mitochondria when their proteasomal degradation is blocked', 'Consistent with being UPS substrates , stabilization of both sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts was observed in a ts- mutant of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme ( uba1-204; Figure 2D;\\xa0Ghaboosi and Deshaies , 2007 ) , indicating that ubiquitination is required for their degradation', 'Moreover , ubiquitin-modified forms of sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts were evident when proteasome function was inhibited ( Figure 2E and F and see Figure 2—figure supplement 1F for an additional control ) , as indicated by characteristic higher molecular weight bands and a smear representing highly ubiquitinated species ( Emmerich and Cohen , 2015 )', 'By comparison , ubiquitinated forms of WT SAM35HA and SEN2HA are much less prevalent ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1G ) . We further assessed whether ubiquitin-modified forms of the ts- proteins were localized to mitochondria under conditions of proteasome impairment', 'Ubiquitinated sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts both accumulated largely in the mitochondrial pellet fraction ( P12 , 000xg; Figure 2—figure supplement 1H ) and to a lesser extent in the soluble fraction , correlating with the relative distributions of unmodified species', 'Taken together , these data establish roles for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in the turnover of sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts at the MOM . To date , the only ubiquitin ligases known to act on mitochondrial proteins in yeast are SCFMdm30 and Rsp5 ( Belgareh-Touzé et al . , 2017; Cohen et al . , 2008; Escobar-Henriques et al . , 2006; Kowalski et al . , 2018; Wu et al . , 2016 )', 'However , the known mitochondrial substrates for these E3s are native proteins . We assessed whether these E3s also play a role in MAD of QC substrates and found that strains lacking either Mdm30 or Rsp5 function did not affect sam35-2HAts or sen2-1HAts stability ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B )', 'To identify factors involved in targeting these ts- MAD substrates , we screened a yeast deletion library consisting of non-essential known or putative UPS components ( Ravid and Hochstrasser , 2007 ) by CHX chase . Interestingly , we found that san1Δ impaired turnover of sam35-2HAts ( Figure 3A , middle panel ) , while ubr1Δ impaired turnover of sen2-1HAts ( Figure 3B , middle panel )', 'San1 has been implicated in QC of cytosolic and nuclear proteins ( Gardner et al . , 2005; Heck et al . , 2010 ) . Ubr1 is the E3 that ubiquitinates N-end rule substrates , but also plays a prominent role in the turnover of cytosolic proteins and , in some instances , may also degrade ER proteins ( Bartel et al . , 1990; Comyn et al . , 2016; Eisele and Wolf , 2008; Heck et al', ', 2010; Khosrow-Khavar et al . , 2012; Rao et al . , 2001; Scazzari et al . , 2015; Stolz et al . , 2013; Summers et al . , 2013 ) . Since there are examples where these two E3s functionally interact , we assessed turnover in a san1Δ ubr1Δ double deletion strain', 'While ubr1Δ alone did not affect sam35-2HAts turnover ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C ) , loss of Ubr1 in conjunction with san1Δ led to greater stabilization than loss of San1 alone ( Figure 3A , lower panel ) , indicating that Ubr1 can target sam35-2HAts in the absence of San1', 'Loss of San1 , alone or in conjunction with ubr1Δ , did not affect the stability of sen2-1HAts ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and Figure 3B , lower panel ) . Notably , the polyubiquitination of sam35-2HAts ( Figure 3C ) and sen2-1HAts ( Figure 3D ) was greatly reduced when San1 or Ubr1 , respectively , were deleted', 'Neither ts- protein was entirely stabilized by san1Δ ubr1Δ , suggesting that other E3s , perhaps with overlapping specificity or essential functions , may also act on these substrates . Likewise , loss of any single E2 did not stabilize sam35-2HAts ( data not shown )', 'Loss of Ubc4 , an E2 known to function with Ubr1 for select substrates , stabilized sen2-1HAts to a similar degree as ubr1Δ ( Figure 3E ) . To confirm that Ubr1 and San1 can act on ts- proteins at the MOM , we examined the localization of sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts by fractionation in san1Δ and ubr1Δ , respectively', 'In these strains , both ts- proteins still accumulated almost exclusively in the pellet fraction ( Figure 3F and G ) . These results establish that San1 and Ubr1 can function as components of the MAD machinery for proteasome-mediated degradation of sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts , respectively', 'The cytosolic SSA family of Hsp70 chaperones ( Ssa1 , Ssa2 , Ssa3 , and Ssa4 ) is broadly involved in protein folding and refolding , but also plays a role in the degradation of several San1 and Ubr1 QC substrates ( Guerriero et al . , 2013; Heck et al . , 2010; Prasad et al . , 2010; Stolz et al . , 2013 )', \"During protein QC , these chaperones appear to prevent protein aggregation and facilitate ubiquitination ( Huyer et al . , 2004; Metzger et al . , 2008; O'Donnell et al . , 2017; Park et al . , 2007; Scazzari et al . , 2015; Stolz et al . , 2013 ) . However , they have not been implicated in MAD\", 'Interestingly , both sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts were strongly stabilized in a conditional yeast strain where three SSA family members are deleted and the fourth ( SSA1 ) is ts- ( ssa1-45ts; ssa1-45ts ssa2Δ ssa3Δ ssa4Δ ) relative to the control strain ( SSA1; SSA1 ssa2Δ ssa3Δ ssa4Δ; Figure 4A )', 'SSA Hsp70 chaperones can play a role in the sorting of mitochondrial proteins to and into mitochondria ( Deshaies et al . , 1988; Eliyahu et al . , 2012; Young et al . , 2003 ) .

Notably , the SSA1 chaperone was also required for ubiquitination: despite the accumulation of unmodified sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts , ubiquitin-modified forms are dramatically reduced when SSA1 is inactivated ( Figure 4C )', 'This is consistent with the established QC function for SSA chaperones in engaging substrates prior to their ubiquitination ( Shiber and Ravid , 2014 ) . In contrast to the ts- proteins , degradation of the native MOM UPS substrate , Fzo1HA , was largely unaffected by loss SSA function ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B )', 'This is consistent with a dichotomy in chaperone requirements between native and non-native MAD substrates . Hsp40 co-chaperones ( J-proteins ) stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70 , which is required for substrate interactions .

Depletion of\\xa0~90% of Sis1 protein using Sis1 DAmP cells ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1C ) slowed the turnover of both sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts ( Figure 4D ) , while loss of Ydj1 or its ortholog , Hlj1 , did not ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1D )', 'Recent studies indicate that the degradation of many San1 and Ubr1 cytosolic substrates occurs following nuclear import that is dependent both on Ydj1 and the Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factor ( Hsp110 ) Sse1 ( Prasad et al . , 2018; Samant et al . , 2018 ) .

The AAA-ATPase Cdc48 plays a broad role in many QC pathways , generally functioning as a protein ‘unfoldase’ or ‘segregase , ’ while also maintaining protein solubility prior to proteasomal degradation ( Neal et al . , 2017; Ye et al', ', 2017 ) . Cdc48 and its co-factors Npl4 and Ufd1 have been implicated in the UPS-mediated turnover of several yeast MOM proteins ( Cohen et al . , 2008; Heo et al . , 2010; Wu et al . , 2016 ) .

The Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex generally binds to ubiquitinated proteins ( Bodnar et al . , 2018; Park et al . , 2005; Tsuchiya et al . , 2017 ) , acting downstream of E3-mediated ubiquitination', 'Accordingly , we detected a relative increase in ubiquitinated sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts in Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex mutants ( Figure 5C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C ) .

Loss of Vms1 had no effect on the degradation of sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ) , while loss of Doa1 had a small , but significant effect ( Figure 6A )', 'We next examined deletions of each of the UBX ( Ubiquitin-regulatory X ) proteins , a family of Cdc48 binding co-factors containing a C-terminal Ub fold ( UBX ) domain ( Schuberth and Buchberger , 2008; Schuberth et al . , 2004 ) .

It is therefore vital that QC mechanisms dispose of damaged proteins that can compromise function', 'In mammalian cells , this is accomplished at the macroscopic level through mitophagy ( Pickles et al . , 2018 ) .

This MAD QC pathway utilizes factors that have not been previously linked to mitochondria or implicated in MAD of native MOM proteins . It is also not identical to any other cellular QC pathway , although there are points of intersection', 'All of these degradation pathways , unsurprisingly , require 26S proteasome activity . In many cases , the involvement of the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex represents another point of convergence ( Benischke et al . , 2014; Cohen et al . , 2008; Gallagher et al . , 2014; Heo et al . , 2010; Jarosch et al . , 2002; Tanaka et al . , 2010; Wu et al . , 2016; Xu et al . , 2011 )', 'However , tail-anchored proteins mistargeted to mitochondria and unimported mitochondrial precursors that accumulate at the mitochondrial surface following mitochondrial import stress also require the AAA-ATPase Msp1 for their recognition and extraction from mitochondria ( Chen et al . , 2014; Matsumoto et al . , 2019; Okreglak and Walter , 2014; Weidberg and Amon , 2018; Wohlever et al . , 2017 )', 'We found Msp1 to be dispensable for the degradation of mitochondrial ts- substrates .

Here , we provide strong evidence for a discrete , functional , mitochondrial pool of Ubx2', 'Interestingly , we find that Ubx2 also interacts with Fzo1 at mitochondria and is required for its degradation . This raises the interesting possibility that Ubx2 , as well as its mammalian ortholog UbxD8 , will have a broad role in MAD and mitochondrial homeostasis in addition to its role in ERAD', 'Consistent with this , while this manuscript was in preparation , a role for Ubx2 in the turnover of mitochondrial precursor proteins arrested in the Tom40 translocon was reported ( Mårtensson et al . , 2019 )', 'With regard to ubiquitination , we find no evidence for the involvement of Rsp5 or SCFMdm30 ubiquitin ligases , which are both implicated in ubiquitination of native MOM proteins and/or maintenance of mitochondrial integrity ( Belgareh-Touzé et al . , 2017; Cohen et al . , 2008; Escobar-Henriques et al . , 2006; Fritz et al . , 2003; Wu et al . , 2016 )', 'Instead , San1 and Ubr1 , which have broad roles as quality control E3s for misfolded cytosolic and nuclear proteins ( Amm et al . , 2016; Amm and Wolf , 2016; Eisele and Wolf , 2008; Gardner et al . , 2005; Guerriero et al . , 2013; Heck et al . , 2010; Khosrow-Khavar et al . , 2012; Lewis and Pelham , 2009; Nillegoda et al . , 2010; Prasad et al . , 2012; Prasad et al . , 2018; Samant et al', ', 2018; Summers et al . , 2013 ) , are required to degrade mitochondrial ts- substrates .

      "\t ['Cdc48/p97 , a ubiquitin-selective chaperone , orchestrates the function of E3 ligases and deubiquitylases ( DUBs ) . Here , we identify a new function of Cdc48 in ubiquitin-dependent regulation of mitochondrial dynamics . The DUBs Ubp12 and Ubp2 exert opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion and cleave different ubiquitin chains on the mitofusin Fzo1', 'We demonstrate that Cdc48 integrates the activities of these two DUBs , which are themselves ubiquitylated . First , Cdc48 promotes proteolysis of Ubp12 , stabilizing pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1 . Second , loss of Ubp12 stabilizes Ubp2 and thereby facilitates removal of ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 inhibiting fusion', 'Thus , Cdc48 synergistically regulates the ubiquitylation status of Fzo1 , allowing to control the balance between activation or repression of mitochondrial fusion . In conclusion , we unravel a new cascade of ubiquitylation events , comprising Cdc48 and two DUBs , fine-tuning the fusogenic activity of Fzo1', 'Mitochondria are dynamic organelles constantly undergoing fusion and fission events , modulated by a variety of post-translational modifiers including ubiquitin ( Escobar-Henriques and Langer , 2014; Komander and Rape , 2012 ) . Due to their pathological relevance , e . g . for Parkinson’s disease , these processes are subject to intense investigation', 'For example , Parkin-dependent ubiquitylation of mitochondrial outer membrane ( OM ) proteins modulates the elimination of the damaged organelles by mitophagy , or via mitochondrial-derived vesicles ( MDV ) that fuse with the late endosome ( Pickrell and Youle , 2015; Sugiura et al . , 2014 ) . Most fusion processes , including the Parkin-MDV pathway , rely on SNAREs ( McLelland et al . , 2016 )', 'In contrast , fusion of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and of mitochondria depend on large dynamin-related GTPases ( Escobar-Henriques and Anton , 2013; Hu and Rapoport , 2016 ) . In mitochondria , they are named mitofusins ( Mfn1/Mfn2 in mammals , Fzo1 in yeast )', 'Deficiencies in Mfn2 cause the type 2 subset of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ( CMT ) , the most common degenerative disorder of the peripheral nervous system ( Züchner et al . , 2004 ) . The ubiquitin-specific chaperone Cdc48/p97 is required to maintain mitochondrial morphology ( Esaki and Ogura , 2012 )', 'However , the underlying molecular mechanism of how Cdc48 regulates mitochondrial dynamics is not understood . Cdc48 is an essential AAA-ATPase and one of the most abundant proteins in the cell , which recognizes many ubiquitylated substrates and is involved in a myriad of biological processes ( Franz et al . , 2014; Meyer and Weihl , 2014 )', 'Cdc48 segregates ubiquitylated substrates from protein complexes , or from membranes , thus allowing their proteolysis by the proteasome ( Franz et al . , 2014 ) . For example , Cdc48 is important for ER-associated protein degradation ( ERAD ) , modulates the turnover of mitochondrial OM proteins ( OMMAD ) , participates in apoptosis responses ( Laun et al', ', 2001 ) and mediates clearance of damaged lysosomes by autophagy ( Avci and Lemberg , 2015; Heo et al . , 2010; Papadopoulos et al . , 2017; Tanaka et al . , 2010; Wu et al . , 2016; Xu et al . , 2011; Zattas and Hochstrasser , 2015 ) . On the other hand , Cdc48 also binds E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitylases ( DUBs ) thereby regulating substrate ubiquitylation ( Meyer and Weihl , 2014 )', 'DUBs are proteases that catalyze the reversion of the ubiquitylation reaction ( Love et al . , 2007 ) , critically contributing to ubiquitin homeostasis ( Amerik and Hochstrasser , 2004; Kimura and Tanaka , 2010; Park and Ryu , 2014; Swatek and Komander , 2016 )', 'DUBs activate ubiquitin by releasing it from ubiquitin precursor polypeptides but are also determinants for the modification status of ubiquitylated substrates , allowing to dampen ubiquitin-mediated events ( Clague et al . , 2013 )', 'Importantly , DUBs are associated with a number of human diseases and represent promising drug targets , whose regulation and mechanism of action need to be explored ( Heideker and Wertz , 2015; Sahtoe and Sixma , 2015 ) . Two deubiquitylases , Ubp2 and Ubp12 , were found to have opposite effects on mitochondrial morphology ( Anton et al . , 2013 )', 'Ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that are recognized and cleaved by Ubp12 activate mitochondrial fusion . In contrast , other ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that instead are recognized and cleaved by Ubp2 target Fzo1 for proteasomal degradation and inhibit mitochondrial fusion', 'Therefore , although it is clear that ubiquitin is a double-faced regulator of mitochondrial fusion ( Escobar-Henriques and Langer , 2014 ) , how Ubp2 and Ubp12 exert opposite effects on Fzo1 and mitochondrial fusion remained poorly studied . Here , we identify a role of Cdc48 in mitochondrial fusion , as part of a novel enzymatic cascade consisting of Cdc48 , Ubp12 and Ubp2', 'Cdc48 negatively regulates Ubp12 , which negatively regulates Ubp2 , explaining why these two DUBs exert opposite effects on their targets and on ubiquitin homeostasis . \\n Although it is clear that Cdc48 affects mitochondrial dynamics ( Esaki and Ogura , 2012 ) , the underlying mechanisms are unclear', 'The role of Cdc48 for mitochondrial morphology was investigated in the hypomorphic mutant cdc48-2 , expressing GFP targeted to mitochondria . In this allele , Cdc48 is mutated for A547T , in its ATPase domain D2 , whereas in the most commonly used cdc48-3 strain , Cdc48 is instead mutated in R387K , in the D1 ATPase ( C . Hickey and M . Hochstrasser , p . communication )', 'Both cdc48-3 and cdc48-2 mutations impair typical Cdc48-dependent processes for transmembrane proteins , like ERAD ( Bays et al . , 2001; Hitchcock et al . , 2001; Latterich et al . , 1995 )', 'We observed that cdc48-2 cells presented fragmented mitochondria ( Figure 1A ) , consistent with the mitochondrial phenotypes observed upon impairment of the ATPase activity of Cdc48 ( Esaki and Ogura , 2012 ) . This suggested problems in mitochondrial fusion and prompted us to evaluate the role of Cdc48 on Fzo1 , present at the outer membrane of mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial fusion is abolished in the absence of Fzo1 ubiquitylation ( Anton et al . , 2013 ) . Consistent with mitochondrial fragmentation , we observed a decrease of Fzo1 ubiquitylation in cdc48-2 mutant cells , when compared to wild-type ( wt ) cells ( Figure 1B , black arrows ) . We have previously shown that pro-fusion ubiquitylation of Fzo1 increases its stability ( Anton et al . , 2013 )', 'Accordingly , the steady state levels of Fzo1 and its ubiquitylated forms were decreased in cdc48-2 cells ( compare Figure 1C and B ) , to a similar and not significantly different extent ( data not shown )', 'Consistent with the cdc48-2 allele , the levels of Fzo1 were slightly decreased in the cdc48-3 mutant or in cells deleted for the Cdc48 co-factors Npl4 , Ufd1 and Ufd3/Doa1 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C ) . It was previously shown that Ubc6 , an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane protein , is degraded by the proteasome via ERAD , a process dependent on Cdc48 ( Lenk et al . , 2002 )', 'Therefore , we also analyzed the steady state levels of Ubc6 in the same CDC48 mutant strains . As expected , and in contrast to Fzo1 , the steady state levels of Ubc6 were increased upon impairment of Cdc48 activity ( Figure 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C ) . This suggested that Cdc48 regulates Fzo1 by a mechanism different from OMMAD or ERAD', 'Since both Fzo1 and Ubc6 were mostly affected in the cdc48-2 mutant , we decided to use this strain for further analysis . However , it is unclear why cdc48-2 affects Ubc6 and Fzo1 stronger than cdc48-3 . We investigated why cdc48-2 mutant cells have lower levels of Fzo1 , by testing with cycloheximide ( CHX ) chase experiments if Cdc48 regulates Fzo1 stability', 'Moreover , to simultaneously test the role of the proteasome , we deleted the efflux pumps Snq2 and Pdr5 . We observed that Fzo1 degradation was inhibited by the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 , indicating that the decreased levels of Fzo1 observed in cdc48-2 cells were due to proteasome-dependent turnover of Fzo1 ( Figure 1D )', 'In contrast , proteasome inhibition did not affect Fzo1 turnover in wt cells consistent with previous observations ( Anton et al . , 2013; Escobar-Henriques et al . , 2006 ) . Importantly , all these phenotypes could be rescued by expression of the wt Cdc48 protein but not by expression of the Cdc48A547T variant , mimicking the specific mutation in cdc48-2 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C )', 'In conclusion , Cdc48 is required to maintain the Fzo1 protein , thus promoting mitochondrial fusion events . We further investigated how Cdc48 affected Fzo1 . Given that stress conditions disrupt mitochondrial tubulation ( Knorre et al . , 2013 ) , it was important to show that Cdc48 directly regulates Fzo1 and mitochondrial morphology', 'First , co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Cdc48 physically interacted with Fzo1 ( Figure 2A ) . We previously showed that the formation of ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 ( Figure 2A , black arrows ) , which are\\xa0linked to lysine 398 , requires previous ubiquitylation of its lysine 464 ( Anton et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , Fzo1 ubiquitylation is lost in the mutant Fzo1K464R ( Figure 2A )', 'We observed that the interaction between Cdc48 and the non-ubiquitylated variant Fzo1K464R was impaired ( Figure 2A ) , in agreement with ubiquitin being recognized by Cdc48 . To assess the specificity of the cdc48-2 effect on Fzo1 protein levels , we tested if this depended on Fzo1 ubiquitylation . Thus , the non-ubiquitylated variant Fzo1K464R was used', 'We observed that the steady state levels of Fzo1K464R were largely insensitive to the cdc48-2 mutation ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . This points to a direct regulatory role of Cdc48 on Fzo1 , only after its ubiquitylation . These pro-fusion ubiquitin forms on Fzo1 are recognized by Ubp12 . In addition , we previously identified other ubiquitin forms on Fzo1 , that inhibit fusion', 'They are removed by Ubp2 and can be detected only in the presence of the catalytically inactive variant Ubp2C745S ( Anton et al . , 2013 ) ( Figure 2B , Input , red arrows ) . Therefore , we investigated binding of Cdc48 to Fzo1 under these conditions , where both pro-fusion and anti-fusion forms are present', 'We noticed that despite the clear increase in ubiquitylation of Fzo1 upon Ubp2C745S expression ( 2 . 44 times ) , Cdc48 binding to Fzo1 was not increased ( Figure 2B ) . Therefore , the additional presence of ubiquitin chains inhibiting fusion does not increase Cdc48 binding', 'Consistently , for the Fzo1K464R variant , which in the presence of Ubp2C745S is ubiquitylated to a similar level as the wt protein ( 0 . 96 times , despite the absence of pro-fusion ubiquitylation ) , no binding to Cdc48 above background can be detected . Thus , similar to Ubp12 , Cdc48 recognizes specifically the pro-fusion ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1', 'Given the specific interaction of both Cdc48 ( Figure 2B ) and Ubp12 ( Anton et al . , 2013 ) with ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 promoting fusion , we tested if Cdc48 regulated Ubp12 . To analyze if Ubp12 is an unstable protein , wt and cdc48-2 cells were transformed with an episomal plasmid expressing Ubp12 under the ADH1 promoter ( Anton et al . , 2013 )', 'CHX chase experiments revealed that Ubp12 is degraded in a Cdc48- and proteasome-dependent manner ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B ) . Similarly , chromosomally tagged Ubp12 is an unstable protein and its turnover depends on Cdc48 ( Figure 3A ) . To analyze if Ubp12 is ubiquitylated , the DUB was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting for Ubp12-Flag or for ubiquitin ( Figure 3B )', 'We observed slower migrating forms of Ubp12 with the Flag-specific antibody , which were also detected by a ubiquitin-specific antibody . These studies demonstrated that Ubp12 is modified by ubiquitin . We next tested whether Cdc48 could be co-immunoprecipitated with Ubp12 , from solubilized crude mitochondrial extracts', 'We observed that Ubp12 physically interacted with Cdc48 ( Figure 3C ) , suggesting that Cdc48 directly supports degradation of ubiquitylated Ubp12 . Our results show that Cdc48 and Ubp12 have opposing roles on Fzo1 ubiquitylation levels ( Figure 1B and [Anton et al . , 2013] )', 'Consistently , Ubp12 and Cdc48 also present opposing phenotypes regarding mitochondrial tubulation ( Figure 1A and [Anton et al . , 2013] ) . Given that Cdc48 controls Ubp12 levels , we speculated that Cdc48 regulates mitochondrial morphology and Fzo1 via Ubp12 . We monitored mitochondrial morphology in cdc48-2 cells in presence or absence of UBP12 , expressing mitochondrial-targeted GFP', 'Strikingly , deletion of UBP12 in cdc48-2 cells rescued mitochondrial tubulation , resembling Δubp12 cells ( Figure 4A ) . Importantly , the mitochondrial hypertubulation of Δubp12 cells depended on Fzo1 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C )', 'Even in Δfzo1 Δdnm1 cells , resembling wt cells in mitochondrial shape , further deletion of UBP12 did not induce hypertubulation , confirming that Ubp12 regulates mitochondrial morphology via Fzo1 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1D ) . Mitochondrial fusion is also required to maintain the cellular growth on respiratory media , i . e', 'media containing the non-fermentable carbon sources glycerol or lactate ( Hermann et al . , 1998 ) . Therefore , to further support the physiological importance of Cdc48 and Ubp12 , we analyzed the respiratory capacity of cdc48-2 in presence or absence of UBP12', 'In agreement with restored tubulation of mitochondria , we observed that the growth defect of cdc48-2 cells at 37°C on lactate media could be improved upon deletion of UBP12 ( Figure 4B ) . Given that Δfzo1 cells irreversibly loose mitochondrial DNA , we investigated if this is also the case for cdc48-2 cells', 'Consistent with the respiratory reversibility of cdc48-2 cells upon further deletion of UBP12 , we observed that cdc48-2 cells did not lose mitochondrial DNA ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and B ) . Importantly , the respiratory defect of cdc48-2 cells could be complemented by expression of Cdc48 but not of Cdc48A547T ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2C )', 'Finally , cdc48-2Δubp12 cells also showed improved ubiquitylation of Fzo1 ( Figure 4C ) . Together , these results show that Cdc48 maintains Fzo1 ubiquitylation and activates mitochondrial fusion by downregulating Ubp12 . However , two pieces of evidence suggest that Cdc48 might have other functions in this pathway , apart from regulating Ubp12', 'First , we observed that the physical interaction between Fzo1 and Cdc48 is not mediated by Ubp12 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2D ) , suggesting that Cdc48 directly recognizes ubiquitylated Fzo1 . Second , deletion of UBP12 in cdc48-2 cells did not restore the steady state levels of Fzo1 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2E )', 'Notably , this is consistent with our previous observation that mitochondrial fusion depends on ubiquitylated rather than on the steady state levels of Fzo1 ( Anton et al . , 2013 ) . We noticed that increased levels of Fzo1 , present in ∆ubp12 cells , specifically depended on Ubp2 ( Figure 5A )', 'Therefore , Ubp12 and Ubp2 , which affect the stability of Fzo1 in opposite manners , are also interdependent . Next , we analyzed if Ubp2 and Ubp12 also presented other opposing and interdependent phenotypes related to ubiquitin', 'First , we analyzed cellular growth of cells lacking UBP2 , UBP12 or both , in the presence of sub-lethal doses of CHX , a phenotype commonly tested to monitor imbalances in ubiquitin homeostasis ( Gerlinger et al . , 1997; Hanna et al . , 2003; Rumpf and Jentsch , 2006 ) . Second , we directly quantified the levels of free ubiquitin vs . substrate-conjugated ubiquitin in the same strains', 'We observed that indeed Ubp2 and Ubp12 had opposite phenotypes ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . In addition , the consistent interdependence of these two enzymes suggested a DUB hierarchy , which prompted us to test a possible regulation of the Ubp2 protein by Ubp12', 'We tested if Ubp2 is an unstable protein and whether Ubp12 is involved in its degradation , after inhibition of protein synthesis with CHX . The levels of genomically tagged Ubp2 decreased over time and Ubp2-turnover was regulated by Ubp12 ( Figure 5B ) and by the proteasome ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2A )', 'Moreover , co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Ubp2 interacted with Ubp12 , suggesting a direct regulation between both DUBs ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2B ) . We therefore investigated if Ubp2 could be ubiquitylated , in a Ubp12-dependent manner . After immunoprecipitation of Ubp2-Flag , and consistent with recent observations ( Cavellini et al', ', 2017 ) , we observed the presence of slowly migrating forms of Ubp2 during electrophoresis , in wt cells ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2C ) but mostly in Δubp12 cells ( Figure 5C , left panel )', 'Importantly , we show that these forms could also be detected using a ubiquitin-specific antibody , demonstrating that they represent ubiquitylated Ubp2 ( Figure 5C and Figure 5—figure supplement 2C , right panels )', 'This indicates that Ubp12 mediates deubiquitylation of Ubp2 and suggests that Ubp2 acts downstream of Ubp12 , thus revealing a hierarchical cascade between DUBs , of relevance for the protein levels of Fzo1 and for ubiquitin homeostasis', 'In contrast to numerous proteins that are destabilized in absence of DUBs , deletion of UBP12 stabilizes Fzo1 ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) and Ubp2 ( Figure 5B ) . Consistently , the two other known substrates of Ubp12 – Rad23 ( Gödderz et al . , 2017 ) and Gpa1 ( Wang et al . , 2005 ) are also not destabilized in\\xa0Δubp12 cells', 'To characterize the deubiquitylation reaction of Ubp12 in more detail , we analyzed the ubiquitin linkages on Fzo1 and Ubp2 accumulating in\\xa0Δubp12 cells . Overexpression of ubiquitin mutated in K48R strongly decreased Fzo1 and Ubp2 ubiquitylation , revealing that their ubiquitin chains are linked via K48 ( Figure 6A and C )', 'However , the\\xa0ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that destabilize it and inhibit fusion , which are not bound by Ubp12 , are also K48-linked ( Figure 6B ) ( Anton et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , differences in ubiquitin chains cannot explain why Ubp12\\xa0stabilizes\\xa0its\\xa0substrates . To further analyze Ubp12 , its ubiquitin chain preference was tested using in vitro deubiquitylation assays ( Hospenthal et al', ', 2015 ) . As a substrate , we used either K48-linked or K63-linked ubiquitin , present in the form of either di-ubiquitin ( Figure 6D ) or ubiquitin chains ( Figure 6E ) . However , in all cases , Ubp12 revealed no chain preference ( Figure 6D , E ) . This suggested that it is not Ubp12 but rather\\xa0the chains themselves\\xa0on the substrates that prevent their turnover', 'Thus , we determined the number of ubiquitin moieties present on Fzo1 , upon co-expression of tagged and non-tagged ubiquitin molecules . We observed that co-expression of ubiquitin and Myc-ubiquitin decomposed the first ubiquitylated form of Fzo1 , i . e running closest to non-modified Fzo1 , into two bands ( Figure 6F )', 'This corresponds to the presence of either ubiquitin or Myc-ubiquitin attached to Fzo1 and confirms that this form corresponds to mono-ubiquitylated Fzo1 . Interestingly , however , for the two other ubiquitylated forms with lower electrophoretic mobility , we observed that only two additional bands could be observed above each of them', 'They correspond to either the presence of two Myc-ubiquitin molecules or one ubiquitin and one Myc-ubiquitin conjugated to Fzo1 . These results suggest that the K48 chains on Fzo1 consist of two ubiquitin moieties . In conclusion , Ubp12 recognizes ubiquitylated chains on Fzo1 composed of a very small number of ubiquitin moieties', 'We therefore propose that Ubp12 does not stabilize its substrates because their ubiquitin chains are too short to target proteasomal turnover . Both Ubp12 and Ubp2 deubiquitylate Fzo1 , but they clearly bind different forms of ubiquitylated Fzo1 ( Anton et al . , 2013 ) . Ubp12 binds ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1 that stabilize Fzo1 and promote mitochondrial fusion', 'In turn , Ubp2 recognizes other ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1 , that instead signal Fzo1 turnover thus preventing mitochondrial fusion . Given that Ubp12 acts upstream of Ubp2 , we speculated that the pro-fusion ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1 , Ubp12-specific , would also precede its Ubp2-specific anti-fusion forms . This predicts an impairment of anti-fusion forms in the absence of pro-fusion forms', 'Therefore , as previously , the mutant Fzo1K464R was chosen as a tool , because it loses the pro-fusion ubiquitylation ( Figure 7A , inset , black arrows , compare lanes 1 and 2 ) . Moreover , as in Figure 2B , the catalytically-inactive Ubp2C745S protein was expressed additionally', 'This allows visualization of the Ubp2-specific anti-fusion forms as well ( Figure 7A , inset , red arrows , lane 3 ) , resulting in a massive increase in overall ubiquitylation of Fzo1 ( compare lanes 1 and 3 ) . As predicted by our hypothesis , much of this increase was lost when K464 was mutated to R ( compare lanes 3 and 4 )', 'This shows that Ubp2-dependent ubiquitylation largely requires previous K464-dependent\\xa0ubiquitylation . Therefore , pro-fusion ubiquitylation , which stabilizes Fzo1 , primes Fzo1 for the formation of anti-fusion ubiquitylation . These anti-fusion forms , instead , signal Fzo1 for proteasomal degradation , so that in Δubp2 cells Fzo1 is less abundant ( Anton et al . , 2013 )', 'Taking this into consideration , the steady state levels of Fzo1 were used as a read-out for the presence of anti-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1 . We noticed that whereas the steady state levels of Fzo1 decreased by 91% inΔubp2 cells , as expected , the steady state levels of Fzo1K464R only decreased by 47% ( Figure 7B )', 'This shows that Fzo1K464R is much less sensitive to the deletion of UBP2 than wt Fzo1 , consistent with a lower abundance of the anti-fusion ubiquitylation . To confirm this result , the levels of Fzo1 were also tested upon further deletion of MDM30 inΔubp2 cells , which encodes the E3 ligase-component responsible for pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1 ( Cohen et al', ', 2008; Escobar-Henriques et al . , 2006; Fritz et al . , 2003 ) . Indeed , we could observe a rescue of Fzo1 steady state levels inΔubp2 Δmdm30 cells , confirming that pro-fusion precedes anti-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1 ( Figure 7C )', 'We conclude that Ubp2-specific ubiquitylation of Fzo1 largely depends on Ubp12-specific ubiquitylation of Fzo1 , indicating a regulatory cascade of Ubp12 and Ubp2 on Fzo1 . To challenge the Cdc48-DUBs regulatory cascade , we first tested if the role of Cdc48 on Fzo1 steady state levels depended on Ubp2 and Ubp12', 'Indeed , and in contrast to wt cells , in ∆ubp2 ∆ubp12 cells the steady state levels of Fzo1 were insensitive to further mutating Cdc48 ( Figure 8A ) . Moreover , ∆ubp2 cells and ∆ubp2 ∆ubp12 were similarly insensitive to the presence of the cdc48-2 allele ( Figure 8B ) , consistent with the UBP2 UBP12 epistasis results ( Figure 5A and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B )', 'Next , we tested if overexpression of Ubp2 could rescue cdc48-2 phenotypes . This was to be expected because deletion of UBP12 rescues CDC48 mutant phenotypes but also leads to increased levels of Ubp2 . Consistently , mitochondrial tubulation was significantly improved under these conditions ( Figure 8C )', 'Moreover , Ubp2 overexpression improved the growth defect of cdc48-2 cells on lactate media at the non-permissive temperature of 37°C , supporting the physiological impact of the Ubp2 levels in cdc48-2 cells ( Figure 8D ) . Therefore , the respiratory capacity of the cdc48-2 cells could be improved not only by UBP12 deletion but also by overexpression of Ubp2', 'Finally , a physical interaction between Ubp2 and Cdc48 could be observed ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ) . Together our results highlight a model in which Cdc48 , Ubp12 and Ubp2 orchestrate a multilayered cascade regulation , culminating on Fzo1 ubiquitylation and mitochondrial fusion . \\n Cdc48 promotes degradation of Ubp12 , controlling Fzo1 ubiquitylation', 'Ubp12 prevents mitochondrial fusion by two means . On the one hand , it removes the ubiquitylation on Fzo1 that is required for fusion . On the other hand , it promotes degradation of Ubp2 . This leaves the anti-fusion ubiquitylation of Fzo1 unopposed , resulting in Fzo1 degradation . Therefore , by supporting turnover of Ubp12 , Cdc48 dually preserves mitochondrial fusion events', 'In contrast , when only a non-functional variant of the protein is present , as is the case in cdc48-2 cells , Cdc48 cannot protect the pro-fusion ubiquitylation of Fzo1 . In this case , the cascade will synergistically converge in degradation of Fzo1 and thus inhibition of mitochondrial fusion will occur', 'The interdependence between these two pathways contributes to a coordinated cellular decision by Cdc48 to either fuse mitochondria or instead prevent it by degrading Fzo1 . Moreover , the Cdc48-Ubp12-Ubp2 cascade allows fine-tuning of substrate ubiquitylation and modulation of the biological processes thereof , as exemplified for Fzo1 and mitochondrial fusion ( Figure 9 )', 'Cdc48/p97 extracts ubiquitylated substrates from membranes , thus allowing their recognition and degradation by the proteasome ( Franz et al . , 2014; Rape et al . , 2001 ) . This is exemplified with the ER protein Ubc6 , and was also shown for mitochondrial OM proteins ( Neutzner et al . , 2007 ) , including mitofusins under damaging conditions ( Tanaka et al . , 2010 )', 'Therefore , Cdc48/p97 and ubiquitin regulate mitochondrial fusion in both yeast and mammals . Moreover , eukaryotes present a similar ubiquitin pattern of mitofusins , suggesting that the new function of Cdc48 presented here could be conserved in mammals under non-damaging conditions', 'Mitochondrial fusion is a complex multistep process dependent on sequential events involving GTP binding and hydrolysis by Fzo1 , Fzo1 oligomerization and finally ubiquitylation of Fzo1 ( Anton et al . , 2011; Brandt et al . , 2016; Cohen et al . , 2011; Ishihara et al . , 2004 )', 'Although it is clear that ubiquitin critically determines mitochondrial fusion events , the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown ( Anton et al . , 2013 ) . The DUBs Ubp12 and Ubp2 cleave different ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1 that either promote or repress mitochondrial fusion , respectively ( Anton et al . , 2013 )', 'Here , given that Ubp12 regulates Ubp2 , we show that these two ubiquitylation pathways are connected . Consistently , on Fzo1 , Ubp12-specific ubiquitylation also precedes Ubp2-specific ubiquitylation . In fact , unopposed anti-fusion ubiquitylation , as it is the case in Δubp2 cells , disrupts mitochondrial tubulation', 'This renders the role of Ubp2 in mitochondrial dynamics quite clear , namely protecting mitochondrial fusion . In contrast , the need for a dedicated DUB that removes the pro-fusion ubiquitylation forms , i . e . the need for Ubp12 , remained unclear', 'Now , the Ubp12-Ubp2 cascade allows to understand the purpose of Ubp12 , solving the paradox of why inhibition of the pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1 is required: in fact , too much pro-fusion ubiquitylation also means too much anti-fusion ubiquitylation , a problem counteracted by the deubiquitylation activity of Ubp12 on Fzo1', 'We conclude that this cascade ensures a tight control of Fzo1 ubiquitylation at levels sufficient to allow mitochondrial fusion but preventing unnecessary ubiquitylation that instead targets Fzo1 for proteasomal turnover . The cascade between Ubp12 and Ubp2 also allows revising recent results linking Ubp2 and Mdm30 ( Cavellini et al . , 2017 )', 'Mdm30 catalyzes the formation of the pro-fusion ubiquitin forms on Fzo1 ( Cohen et al . , 2008 ) . The pro-fusion forms are bound and cleaved by Ubp12 , depend on lysine 464 of Fzo1 , and are essential for mitochondrial fusion ( Anton et al . , 2013 )', 'As to the anti-fusion ubiquitin forms on Fzo1 , two types could now be observed: low molecular weight , K464-independent , anti-fusion ubiquitylation ( as seen in Figure 7A , lane 4 ) , consistent with previous results ( Anton et al . , 2013 ) , but mostly high molecular weight anti-fusion ubiquitylation , instead K464-dependent ( as seen in Figure 7A , lane 3 )', 'This shows that the anti-fusion ubiquitin forms on Fzo1 largely depend on its pro-fusion forms . Therefore , it is not surprising that anti-fusion , Ubp2-specific , ubiquitylation on Fzo1 also largely depends on Mdm30 . Nevertheless , future studies are required to clarify if Mdm30 itself catalyzes the formation of this high molecular weight fraction of the anti-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1', 'Moreover , it is clear that Mdm30 is not the ligase responsible for the anti-fusion low molecular weight forms on Fzo1 ( Anton et al . , 2013 ) , which therefore remains to be identified . Our results unravel for the first time a regulatory cascade of two DUBs , Ubp12 and Ubp2 , with opposing functions in ubiquitin homeostasis', 'A 20–40% depletion in ubiquitin levels leads to cellular growth defects under various stress conditions in yeast , to lethality or infertility in mice , and to neurological diseases like ataxia , gracile axonal dystrophy or Parkinson’s disease ( Kimura and Tanaka , 2010; Park and Ryu , 2014 )', 'The level of free ubiquitin is adjusted to the cellular needs , and is critically regulated by deubiquitylase activity ( Chernova et al . , 2003; Swaminathan et al . , 1999 ) . Here , we reveal distinct roles of two DUBs - Ubp2 and Ubp12 - for the maintenance of ubiquitin homeostasis . Δubp12 cells are hyperresistant to cycloheximide ( CHX ) , a chemical inhibitor of protein translation', 'Similar observations were previously reported in proteasome mutants , with impaired proteolysis ( Gerlinger et al . , 1997 ) . Consistently , just like proteasome mutants , also Δubp12 cells accumulate conjugated ubiquitin , without affecting the levels of free ubiquitin', 'In turn , Δubp2 cells showed a 40% depletion of free ubiquitin and hypersensitivity to CHX , consistent with similar observations in strains presenting decreased free ubiquitin levels ( Hanna et al . , 2003 )', 'Nevertheless , along with reduced free ubiquitin , deletion of UBP2 also clearly led to increased levels of ubiquitin conjugates , as observed upon DmUsp5 depletion in the fruit fly ( Kovács et al . , 2015 ) . In fact , the importance of free ubiquitin pools versus ubiquitin conjugates for cellular growth is not well understood', 'Our analysis of Δubp2 cells sheds light on this question , demonstrating that depletion of free ubiquitin is epistatic over the accumulation of ubiquitylated conjugates for cellular growth', 'What could justify the opposite behavior of Ubp2 and Ubp12 in ubiquitin homeostasis and substrate turnover ? The removal of ubiquitin from a substrate is generally expected to increase its stability , as observed for Fzo1 in Δubp2 cells', 'Consistently , Ubp2 appears as a general quality control deubiquitylase recognizing both K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains that signal for turnover , both by the UPS and by the lysosome ( Anton et al . , 2013; Fang et al . , 2016; Ho et al . , 2017; Silva et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , the turnover of both Fzo1 and Ubp2 is decreased in Δubp12 cells', 'Moreover , Ubp12 does not stabilize Rad23 ( Gödderz et al . , 2017 ) and Gpa1 ( Wang et al . , 2005 ) , i . e . its two other known substrates . Ubp12 exhibits a broad substrate specificity in vitro recognizing both K48- and K63-linked chains , consistent with previous observations ( Schaefer and Morgan , 2011 ) . Thus , it is not Ubp12 but the substrate that behaves unexpectedly', 'Notably , the ubiquitin signals that accumulate in Fzo1 , Ubp2 , Rad23 and Gpa1 are all composed of a limited number of discrete bands , instead of the high molecular weight smear , typical for polyubiquitylated substrates . For Fzo1 , we find that Ubp12 recognizes ubiquitylated forms that only contain two ubiquitin moieties that are linked via K48', 'We propose that the presence of a short number of ubiquitin molecules on the ubiquitin chains recognized by Ubp12 could explain why they do not serve as a good signal for proteasomal degradation . The protein Met4 was also shown to be ubiquitylated with a a limited number of discrete bands ( Flick et al . , 2004; Kuras et al . , 2002 )', 'In this case , intramolecular association with a ubiquitin binding domain in Met4 shields the ubiquitin chains , thus preventing their elongation and protecting Met4 against proteasomal degradation ( Flick et al . , 2006; Tyrrell et al . , 2010 ) . How deubiquitylation is controlled is poorly understood', 'Our findings suggest that this involves ubiquitylation of the DUBs themselves , because both Ubp2 and Ubp12 are regulated by ubiquitylation . This consequently renders DUBs interdependent , as exemplified with Ubp12 being the DUB of Ubp2 . Interestingly , several examples in the literature illustrate a big diversity of DUB regulation ( Michel et al . , 2017 )', 'Therefore , additional mechanisms to proteolysis for the atypical function of Ubp2 ubiquitylation can be proposed . For example , Ubp2 ubiquitylation could induce a conformational change favouring catalytic activity , as observed for the DUB ATXN3 ( Todi et al . , 2010 ) . This is supported by the observation that Ubp2 is among the largest yeast DUBs', 'In addition , several residues of Ubp2 were found to be phosphorylated ( Swaney et al . , 2013 ) , suggesting that coordinated ubiquitylation/phosphorylation events could increase its activity . Finally , given that many DUBs often act as part of protein complexes , Ubp2 ubiquitylation could favor its interaction with Ubp12 and/or Cdc48', 'This could release autoinhibition by a conformational change , as observed for the DUB Ubp6 upon binding to the proteasome , i . e . a AAA+\\xa0ATPase like Cdc48 ( Hanna et al . , 2006 ) . In fact , Cdc48 has been shown to associate with several DUBs ( Ossareh-Nazari et al . , 2010; Papadopoulos et al . , 2017; Rumpf and Jentsch , 2006; Uchiyama et al', ', 2002 ) but also recognizes ubiquitylated proteins , consistent with its interaction with both Ubp12 and Ubp2 . Therefore , DUB ubiquitylation could allow recruitment of Cdc48 and provide a platform guiding DUBs to their relevant substrates . This would also justify the need for Fzo1-Cdc48 physical interaction', 'In fact , a local regulation of Fzo1 by Cdc48 could allow increased efficiency of the Cdc48-DUB cascade on Fzo1 regulation . In conclusion , our results suggest that Cdc48 serves as a binding platform allowing cross-talk regulation between DUBs , bringing new insights into the knowledge of ubiquitin biology', 'These general findings open new perspectives to address some poorly understood questions , e . g . how Cdc48 regulates homotypic fusion events and how DUBs are interdependently regulated , possibly accounting for the multitude of DUBs present in a cell . \\n See Table 1 for details of all yeast strains used .

Hypersynthesis of proinsulin ( Arunagiri et al . , 2018; Back et al . , 2009 ) is a condition proposed to increase proinsulin misfolding ( Liu et al', ', 2005; Scheuner et al . , 2005 ) — which can promote ER stress with abnormal ß-cell ER expansion — whereas suppression of proinsulin protein synthesis actually alleviates ß-cell ER stress ( Szabat et al . , 2016 )', 'Insulin-deficiency caused directly by proinsulin misfolding has been proved unequivocally in an autosomal-dominant form of diabetes known as Mutant INS-gene-induced Diabetes of Youth ( MIDY ) ( Liu et al . , 2010b ) , which occurs in patients bearing one mutant and one wild-type INS allele ( Liu et al . , 2015; Støy et al . , 2010 )', 'The disease in humans is pathogenetically identical to that seen in the mutant Akita diabetic mouse ( Izumi et al . , 2003 ) or Munich MIDY Pig ( Blutke et al . , 2017 ) – which are animals expressing one mutant INS allele encoding proinsulin-C ( A7 ) Y that is quantitatively misfolded due to an inability to form the Cys ( B7 ) -Cys ( A7 ) disulfide bond', 'Ordinarily the expression of only one WT INS allele would be sufficient to avoid diabetes , but Akita mice develop diabetes despite expressing three alleles encoding WT proinsulin in addition to the one encoding mutant proinsulin ( Liu et al . , 2010b )', 'Both preclinical and clinical data prove that in MIDY , it is the expression of misfolded proinsulin that triggers diabetes; yet MIDY is a rare disease . Of far broader significance is the β-cell failure that accompanies ‘garden variety’ T2D without INS mutations , and though the molecular pathogenesis of insulin deficiency in this condition remains murky ( Halban et al', ', 2014 ) , β-cell ER stress is a recognized part of the disease . It has been suggested that β-cells compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin production that may eventually overwhelm the ER capacity for efficient protein folding , thereby provoking β-cell ER stress ( Back and Kaufman , 2012; Eizirik et al . , 2008; Herbert and Laybutt , 2016; Papa , 2012; Rabhi et al', ', 2014; Volchuk and Ron , 2010 ) . However , in the absence of INS gene mutations , it has not been established the extent to which proinsulin misfolding is present in the early triggering stages of T2D , including prediabetes and mild dysglycemia — prior to more obvious islet failure including β-cell degranulation and dedifferentiation ( Accili et al . , 2016; Kahn , 1998; Kahn et al', ', 2009 ) that occurs in both human islets ( Cinti et al . , 2016 ) and rodent islets ( Ishida et al . , 2017 )', 'In this study , we have exploited several independent lines of evidence to establish the presence of aberrant disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes in the β-cells of human islets and model systems , in states that alter the ER folding environment , and in T2D progression prior to onset of β-cell dedifferentiation ( Bensellam et al . , 2018 ) or death ( Eizirik and Millard , 2014; Kanekura et al', ', 2015; Marchetti et al . , 2012; Papa , 2012 ) . \\n Both murine islets and the INS1 ( rat ) pancreatic ß-cell line cells secrete successfully-folded proinsulin in addition to processed insulin .

In several preparations , disulfide-linked dimers were prominent , along with a lesser abundance of higher-order complexes ( Figure 3A right panel )', 'In human islets obtained from other individual donors , disulfide-linked dimers were less prominent ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A )', 'Overnight treatment of human islets with PERK inhibitor resulted in a further increase in higher order disulfide-linked complexes ( Figure 3A right panel , and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) and an increase in total islet proinsulin as revealed by reducing SDS-PAGE ( Figure 3A left panel )', 'These data indicate that aberrant disulfide-linked proinsulin dimers and higher complexes exist in human islets and their abundance responds to changes in environmental conditions within the ER', 'The immunodetection of both disulfide-linked dimers and higher-order complexes was blocked when pure human C-peptide competitor was included in the immunoblotting protocol ( Figure 3B ) , demonstrating specificity . PERK inhibitor has a rapid onset of action on its target , but it appears that the impact of this inhibition to globally alter the proinsulin folding environment of the ER ( Wang et al', ', 2013 ) may take a half-day or more ( Figure 2A ) . More immediately , nascent proinsulin binds the hsp70 family member , BiP ( Liu et al . , 2005; Scheuner et al', ', 2005 ) ; thus , for a more direct perturbation , we exposed islets to the bacterial SubAB protease that is endocytosed and retrieved to the ER lumen where it cleaves the ER chaperone BiP within a matter of a few hours or less ( Paton et al . , 2006 )', 'In mouse islets , BiP was\\xa0≥90% destroyed within 2 hr after SubAB addition ( Figure 3C upper left ) , and immunoblotting revealed that this treatment shifted the majority of proinsulin into larger disulfide-linked complexes ( Figure 3C lower right )', 'Similarly , in a rodent ß-cell line , improperly folded proinsulin began to migrate increasingly in disulfide-linked complexes 80 min after SubAB addition when only a portion of intracellular BiP had been destroyed ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) . BiP cleavage was also confirmed by appearance of the\\xa0~28 kD C-terminal BiP cleavage fragment ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C )', 'In the islets of humans not known to have T2D , improperly folded disulfide-linked proinsulin dimers were already apparent prior to SubAB addition , and an increase in larger-sized covalent proinsulin complexes was apparent at 4 hr of SubAB treatment ( Figure 3D lower panel )', 'These data demonstrate an acute increase in improper folding of human proinsulin , without any INS gene mutation , under conditions of BiP deficiency within the ß-cell ER luminal environment', 'The hsp90 family member of the ER , GRP94 , also impacts on proinsulin handling in ß-cells , especially resulting in aberrant post-ER processing with markedly abnormal appearing secretory granules ( Ghiasi et al', ', 2019 ) ; however , treatment of ß-cells with GRP94 inhibitor ( PU-WS13 , 20 µM ) even for 24 hr did not promote proinsulin disulfide-linked complex formation , and did not exacerbate the proinsulin disulfide-linked complex formation that was triggered by an acute ( 3 hr ) loss of BiP ( Figure 4A )', 'Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that after SubAB treatment of ß-cells , the intracellular distribution of proinsulin shifted from its usual predominant juxtanuclear localization [in the Golgi region from which newly-made insulin granules emerge ( Haataja et al . , 2013 ) to a co-localization with the ER marker , calnexin ( Figure 4B )', 'Altogether , these data strongly indicate that proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes are misfolded and are retained within the ER compartment . The predominant juxtanuclear Golgi-regional distribution of proinsulin is a feature of normal rodent islets ( Orci et al . , 1985 ) ( Figure 4C first set of panels )', 'Within the first 4–5 months of life , leptin receptor mutant LepRdb/db mice in a C57BL/6 background become severely diabetic and develop a paucity of islet ß-cells immunostainable for mature insulin — indeed , the fraction of islet ß-cells that exhibit little or no insulin immunostaining is known to increase by more than 5-fold compared to the islets of age-matched control mice ( Ishida et al', ', 2017 ) . However , we observed that proinsulin-positive immunostaining amongst the cells in these diabetic islets was more widespread and the intracellular distribution of proinsulin within these islet ß-cells was no longer as concentrated in the Golgi region ( Figure 4C second and third set of panels ) with increased localization in the ER ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 )', 'It has been established that limiting food intake of these animals can substantially increase the percentage of strongly insulin-immunopositive ß-cells per islet ( Ishida et al . , 2017 ) . Indeed , upon fasting overnight , the islets of diabetic LepRdb/db mice exhibited a more robust immunostaining of mature insulin ( Figure 4C fourth and fifth set of panels )', 'Additionally , after fasting , there was a shift in intracellular proinsulin back towards a juxtanuclear distribution ( Figure 4C fourth and fifth set of panels ) , consistent with previous reports ( Alarcon et al . , 2016 )', 'The data of Figure 4 strongly suggest that in ad lib fed LepRdb/db diabetic mice , initial insulin depletion does not preclude ongoing proinsulin expression; moreover , a shift of proinsulin distribution towards an ER-like pattern ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) may suggest a stressed state that may be preventable and to some extent reversible by limiting ß-cell secretory stimulation ( i . e', ', ‘ß-cell rest’ ) ( Ishida et al . , 2017 ) . We wondered if the ER-like distribution of intracellular proinsulin in LepRdb/db mice might be explained by ( nonmutant ) proinsulin folding exceeding the ER folding capacity of these ß-cells , resulting in the accumulation of improperly folded species', 'With this in mind , we performed proinsulin immunoblotting after nonreducing and reducing SDS-PAGE in LepRdb/db islet lysates , with islet lysates from wild-type mice , or those bearing only one of 4 functional Ins alleles , as controls . Under reducing conditions , >99% of proinsulin was monomeric ( and insulin was recovered as the reduced insulin B-chain , Figure 4D right )', 'We examined proinsulin in the islet lysates of 5 additional prediabetic LepRdb/db mice — all were similar to the islets of two animals shown in Figures 4D ( 4 and 6 weeks of age with random blood glucose levels of 101 and 118 mg/dL , respectively ) containing a large steady state level of proinsulin ( seen upon Western blotting of reducing SDS-PAGE ) with\\xa0>90% of molecules entangled in disulfide-linked dimers and higher-order complexes ( seen by Western blotting upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE , Figure 4D )', 'Accumulation of misfolded proinsulin in the ER of LepRdb/db ß-cells was always present before the onset of diabetes . These bands are indeed proinsulin , as they were absent from islets of mice depleted of three of four Ins alleles; Figure 4D lane 3 ) . Importantly , improperly folded proinsulin was also detectable in WT mouse islets , albeit at a much lower abundance ( Figure 4D lane 4 )', 'Because leptin receptors might have direct actions on ß-cells ( Marroquí et al . , 2012 ) , we also examined islets from LepR-Nkx2 . 1 KO mice that are deficient for leptin receptor in the hypothalamus but not in the islets ( Ring and Zeltser , 2010 )', 'Here too , pancreatic islets from these hyperphagic , obese , glucose intolerant animals demonstrated markedly increased abundance of disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes with\\xa0>90% of proinsulin entangled in such complexes ( Figure 4E )', 'These data indicate that an increase in improper proinsulin folding in leptin receptor-deficient animals is secondary to a prediabetic state and unrelated to leptin receptor function in ß-cells', 'Crucially , these data also demonstrate that improper proinsulin folding is already detectable at a time that has been associated with ER stress response ( Herbert and Laybutt , 2016 ) but before onset of chronic hyperglycemia associated with pancreatic insulin deficiency that has been attributed to a loss of functional ß-cell mass [regardless of whether this is due to de-differentiation ( Bensellam et al', ', 2018 ) or ß-cell death ( Eizirik and Millard , 2014; Kanekura et al . , 2015; Marchetti et al . , 2012; Papa , 2012 ) or both] . Based on the work of Laybutt et al', '( 2007 ) , we examined islet protein content of p58ipk ( encoded by DNAJC3 ) as a reliable marker of islet ER stress response , and found that the levels of this ER co-chaperone of BiP began to increase in ad lib fed LepRdb/db mice even before the animals have reached a random blood glucose of 160 mg/dL ( Figure 5A ) . Islet p58ipk protein levels also tended to be elevated in LepR-Nkx2', '1 KO mice ( Figure 5B ) . In the islets of young , normoglycemic homozygous LepRdb/db male mice that are destined for diabetes , proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes ( Figure 5C upper left panel ) were increased slightly above the level observed in heterozygous LepRdb/+ males ( that do not progress to diabetes ) , and islet insulin levels were similarly increased ( lower left panels )', 'With a random blood glucose level in the mid 200’s ( mg/dL ) , islet proinsulin was notably increased ( Figure 5C upper second panel ) and comprised\\xa0>90% of disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes ( upper first panel ) whereas simultaneously , islet insulin levels were dramatically decreased ( lower left panels )', 'With a random blood glucose level\\xa0>500 mg/dL , islet proinsulin and insulin levels were both severely diminished ( Figure 5C left panels ) . In female LepRdb/db mice with a random blood glucose ranging from 156 to 294 mg/dL , insulin levels declined compared to the LepRdb/+ control ( Figure 5C lower right panels )', 'However , for females in this glycemic range , as in males , islet proinsulin was increased ( Figure 5 upper right panel ) and once again , >90% was entangled in disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes ( Figure 5 upper third panel )', 'Additionally , with a random blood glucose of 455 mg/dL , both proinsulin and insulin were severely diminished ( Figure 5C last two sets of panels ) indicating islet decompensation', 'During this progression to diabetes , intracellular proinsulin distribution that initially displayed a prominent juxtanuclear pattern with good co-localization to the Golgi region ( GM130 Golgi marker ) tended to shift towards a staining pattern that was more spread in the cytoplasm , with increased co-localization with the ER marker , calnexin ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) ; although even in the fully diabetic state there appeared to be increased juxtanuclear ( Golgi-like ) proinsulin distribution after overnight fasting ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 )', 'Cys ( A20 ) and Cys ( B19 ) are two of the three most reactive thiols of proinsulin , and they initiate covalent association of B- and A-domains that are required for proinsulin export from the ER ( Haataja et al . , 2016 )', 'Nevertheless , in the redox environment of the pancreatic ß-cell ER , a human mutant proinsulin that retains only two cysteines , named ‘keep-B19/A20’ cannot undergo efficient intramolecular oxidation ( Haataja et al . , 2016 ) . Reactive free thiol availability ( Figure 1A ) is a key to proinsulin participation in intermolecular disulfide-linked complex formation', 'Indeed , each of the myc-tagged human proinsulins keep-B7/A7 and keep-A6/A11 , in addition to keep-B19/A20 , exhibited free thiol availability as determined by alkylation with AMS ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . We expressed each of these recombinant proinsulin mutants in the INS-832/13 ß-cell line ( which already expresses endogenous proinsulin )', 'Because these two-cysteine mutant human proinsulins cannot be exported from the ER and are excellent ERAD substrates in pancreatic ß-cells ( Haataja et al . , 2016 ) , these molecules were largely undetected by immunoblotting . However , in ß-cells treated with proteasome inhibitor ( MG132 for 7 hr ) , myc-tagged proinsulin monomers were detected in all cases ( Figure 6A )', 'Remarkably , not only were these constructs capable of forming disulfide-linked proinsulin homodimers , but the keep-B19/A20 construct in particular recapitulated the situation in which the majority of molecules migrated as disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes ( Figure 6A )', 'With or without MG132 , this behavior was also observed upon expression in 293 T cells that lack endogenous proinsulin ( Figure 6B ) , and these complexes appeared quite similar to those observed in human islets ( Figure 3A , B )', 'To determine if Cys ( B19 ) /Cys ( A20 ) are both necessary and sufficient for generating the full ladder of disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes , we compared the three different human mutant proinsulins noted above that each retain only one set of potential disulfide partners , and a human proinsulin mutant named ‘lose-B19/A20’ in which Cys ( B19 ) and Cys ( A20 ) are mutated whereas positions B7 , A7 , A11 and A20 remain as cysteines', 'Once again , of the mutant human proinsulins that retain only one set of potential disulfide partners , only keep-B19/A20 could efficiently recreate the entire ladder of disulfide-linked complexes similar to that seen for wildtype proinsulin , irrespective of the presence or absence of an engineered myc epitope tag in the C-peptide ( Figure 6C left panel )', 'However , lose-B19/A20 did not efficiently recreate the ladder of disulfide-linked complexes despite entrapment in the ER in a proinsulin construct bearing four Cys residues . These data indicate that the Cys ( B19 ) /Cys ( A20 ) pair is both necessary and sufficient for efficient propagation of disulfide-linked complexes of improperly-folded proinsulin', 'In these experiments , we were struck by the observations 1 ) that all 2-Cys proinsulin mutants have the capability to at least weakly form a covalent dimer , which is essential to the further propagation of these improperly folded complexes into trimers , tetramers , and higher order complexes ( Figure 2B ) , and 2 ) a small fraction of proinsulin dimers appeared to remain even after reducing SDS-PAGE ( Figure 4D; Figure 1—figure supplement 1C )', 'To understand these behaviors , we expressed a series of mutant human proinsulins that retain only a single cysteine ( and thus cannot make more than one intermolecular disulfide bond ) . Although five of the six Cys residues could make a homotypic covalent association , Cys ( A7 ) preferred not to make the disulfide bond ( Figure 7A left panel; quantified in Figure 7B )', 'More significantly , Cys ( B19 ) not only covalently homodimerized with exuberance ( Figure 7A left panel ) but this Cys ( B19 ) -Cys ( B19 ) bond could not be broken at room temperature in SDS-gel sample buffer even in the presence of 200 mM dithiothreitol ( Figure 7A right panel )', 'These data indicate that a Cys ( B19 ) -Cys ( B19 ) disulfide bond between proinsulin monomers predisposes to strongly-associated covalent complexes that are automatically misfolded by omitting the crucial intramolecular Cys ( B19 ) -Cys ( A20 ) disulfide bond , which leaves the critical reactive Cys ( A20 ) residue unpaired and available for further disulfide infidelity', 'Such an initiating event can thus form a nidus for assembly of larger misfolded disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1B ) . \\n It is recognized from human genome-wide association studies and animal models that progression from insulin resistance to pancreatic ß-cell dysfunction is a linchpin in the development of T2D', 'Pancreatic ß-cell ER stress is one of the most frequently described components of T2D in humans and animal models ( Back and Kaufman , 2012; Berry et al . , 2018; Cnop et al . , 2017; Laybutt et al . , 2007; Marchetti et al . , 2007; Rabhi et al . , 2014; Yang et al . , 2016 )', 'While protein misfolding caused by mutations ( in so-called conformational diseases ) is one recognized cause of ER stress , the proximal trigger of beta cell ER stress early in the progression of T2D is unknown , but has been the subject of much speculation', 'It is indisputable that ß-cell ER stress can be triggered by proinsulin misfolding in the setting of INS gene coding sequence mutations ( Liu et al . , 2018 ) but there are also strong reasons to think that even in the absence of INS gene mutations , proinsulin misfolding could be an early feature in the progression of T2D ( Arunagiri et al . , 2018; Riahi et al', ', 2018; Scheuner and Kaufman , 2008 ) . In the present study , we have exploited several independent lines of experimentation to identify a significantly increased population of improperly folded proinsulin in the ER of prediabetic and diabetic ß-cells', 'We establish that proinsulin misfolding includes the inability to successfully complete its three internal disulfide bonds , with a subfraction of proinsulin molecules in the ER bearing unpaired cysteine residues', 'This population of improperly folded proinsulin molecules enters into aberrant disulfide-linked partnerships with other proinsulin molecules in the ER , resulting in misfolded proinsulin complexes that are for the first time identified in the islets of human beings', 'There is strong reason to believe that proinsulin disulfide-linked complex formation provides a status report on the health of the ß-cell ER folding environment . Many studies point to the idea that the activity of ER stress ( UPR ) sensor proteins are required to actively maintain a proper ER chaperone and oxidoreductase environment for optimal proinsulin folding ( Harding et al', ', 2012; Hassler et al . , 2015; Sowers et al . , 2018; Tsuchiya et al . , 2018 ) . Recent work indicates that protein disulfide isomerase is one of the ER luminal factors that regulates the balance of proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes and monomers ( Jang et al . , 2019 ) . Additionally , BiP plays a central role in ER stress sensing ( Amin-Wetzel et al . , 2017 )', 'We show here that even a modest decrease of BiP levels results in improperly folded proinsulin rapidly accumulating in disulfide-linked complexes ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) , supporting that proinsulin folding is highly sensitive to changes in the ER folding environment , which can include excessive proinsulin biosynthesis , altered chaperone and/or oxidoreductase expression , and changes in the rate of clearance of misfolded proinsulin molecules ( Arunagiri et al', ', 2018; Xu et al . , 2018 ) . We believe that these and other ER luminal factors are needed to enhance the efficiency of formation of the proinsulin intramolecular Cys ( B19 ) -Cys ( A20 ) disulfide bond . Not only is this internal disulfide critical to additional native proinsulin disulfide pairing ( Haataja et al', ', 2016 ) ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1A ) , but the availability of free Cys ( B19 ) and Cys ( A20 ) can recapitulate the entire ladder of improperly disulfide linked proinsulin complexes . Several pathways of disulfide propagation are possible , highlighted in Figure 7—figure supplement 1B', 'However , those complexes bearing a homotypic Cys ( B19 ) -Cys ( B19 ) covalent bond are likely to be the most difficult to successfully isomerize , as this bond cannot be broken in vitro even in the presence of SDS plus 200 mM DTT ( Figure 7A ) .

Figure 8 presents a schematic describing our hypothesis regarding how proinsulin misfolding fits into the paradigm of what is known about T2D progression in the LepRdb/db model', 'Our work highlights that throughout the first , compensated stage , improperly folded proinsulin is increased but islet insulin content is still robust ( Figures 4D and 5C ) .

We fine-tuned odor concentration signals , while observing the OSN spike rate , until the desired OSN spike rates were produced ( Figure 3A ) . The odor concentration signals inferred from this method are an ensemble of parabolas with systematically varying peak times and amplitudes ( Figure 3A )', 'The 2D nonlinearity was estimated subsequently by running a ridge regression analysis on spike rate samples from the OSN and PN signals ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 3B , C ) . The estimated 2D nonlinearity showed a strong dependency on the rate-of-change of OSN spike rate ( Figure 3B , C )', 'When the nonlinearity was estimated for samples with a fixed odor concentration value , the PN spike rate rose almost linearly with respect to the rate of change ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 )', 'However , the gain of the PN output with respect to the OSN rate of change decreased monotonically with concentration , suggesting that at least a 2D model is required to describe the OSN-to-PN transformation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . We tested the model by comparing the simulated model output with the experimental PN spike activity ( Figure 3C )', 'With step , ramp , and parabola odor inputs , the experimental outputs were closely matched by the model ( root-mean-square error = 25 spike/s , Figure 3F ) . While the odor-evoked responses were well matched by the model , including peak times and amplitudes , the model output often overestimated the actual PN spike rate before and after the stimulus interval', 'This is because the estimated nonlinearity exhibits a relatively high slope at low input amplitudes ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) , which renders the system highly sensitive to the noisy fluctuations at low OSN spike rates ( Pahlberg and Sampath , 2011 )', 'This problem is thought to be mitigated in olfactory glomeruli by pooling input from a population of OSNs , thereby achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio than provided by a single OSN ( Bhandawat et al . , 2007 )', 'In summary , the proposed simple 2D model provides a decent approximation of the OSN-to-PN transformation and corroborates the notion that PNs mainly encode OSN spike rate and its rate of change in a nonlinear fashion', 'What is the functional consequence of acceleration encoding by antennal lobe PNs ? In signal processing theory , the time derivative , or rate-of-change operation , advances the phase of a time signal . For example , cos ( t ) is the time derivative of sin ( t ) , and its phase is advanced by π/2', 'Similarly , the rate of change of a sample triangle-shaped signal shows an advancement of a peak time , and its acceleration exhibits a peak time that is further advanced ( Figure 4A )', 'Therefore , we reasoned that the computation of the first and second time derivatives ( rate of change and acceleration ) of odor concentrations by OSN and PNs , respectively , acts to advance peak times of olfactory stimuli . To investigate this idea with a larger set of odor stimuli , we designed a set of triangle-shaped odor waveforms with peak times varying uniformly between 0 . 6 s and 1', '7 s after the stimulus onset ( Figure 4B , ‘odor’ curve in Figure 4C ) . As shown in the previous experiments with triangle-shaped stimuli ( Figure 2B ) , OSNs responded in a pulse-shaped pattern ( Figure 4B ) , with the peak response advanced by 400–1000 ms relative to the stimulus peak ( ‘OSN’ curve in Figure 4C )', 'In response to the same panel of odor stimuli , PNs consistently produced peak output ( Figure 4B ) at around 200 ms after the stimulus onset , regardless of the dynamics of the odor/OSN signals ( ‘PN’ curve in Figure 4C )', 'For the parabola-shaped odor stimuli ( Figure 3A ) , the peak OSN and PN responses were similarly advanced in time relative to the odor and OSN peaks ( right plot in Figure 4C ) but were more variable . The advancement of a peak time was previously reported for step-pulse odor stimuli ( Bhandawat et al', ', 2007 ) , and our work confirms this result for a larger set of dynamically varying odor stimuli . Together , we hypothesize that acceleration encoding in the Drosophila antennal lobe allows higher olfactory centers to rapidly respond to onsets of slowly rising odor stimuli . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06651 . 009Figure 4', 'A cascade of rate-of-change encodings leads to a rapid detection of the stimulus onset .

To the best of our knowledge , the encoding of acceleration by an olfactory sensory system has not been demonstrated elsewhere', 'This sensory encoding mechanism is distinguished from other chemosensory systems . For example , in bacterial chemotaxis , the rate of change of a stimulus is computed and fed directly into its motor system that controls the flagellar rotation ( Bourret et al . , 1991 )', 'The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans also exhibits a local-gradient-based chemotaxis behavior , and neurons in its sensorimotor pathway are shown to compute the rate of change of concentration gradients ( Suzuki et al . , 2008 )', \"Why do fruit flies compute acceleration of odor concentrations ? How is the acceleration of an olfactory stimulus relevant to a fly's chemotaxis ? An efficient chemotaxis strategy should depend on the distribution of odor molecules in the behaviorally relevant range , which can be quantified using a Reynolds number ( Weissburg , 2000 )\", 'Habitats of both nematodes and bacteria have low Reynolds numbers ( Re < 1 ) , and thus the odor distribution is primarily determined by a diffusion process', 'In this environment , the steepest local odor gradient can be directly linked to the location of the odor source , and therefore animals in such environments are expected to encode the rate of change of odor concentrations in order to detect the steepest gradient', 'In contrast , flying insects experience fluid mechanics that have relatively high Reynolds numbers ( Re > 10 ) , with turbulence dictating the distribution of odor molecules over the diffusion process . In this regime , the local odor gradient within an odor plume would be less informative in determining the location of the odor source than the distribution of odor plumes over a macroscopic scale', 'In fact , it has been well established that insects , including fruit flies , use a strategy of turning upwind during odor plume encounters , a strategy that does not require interpreting local concentration gradients ( Budick and Dickinson , 2006 ) . Furthermore , the relative position of a flying animal and the distribution of odor plumes evolve rapidly over time', \"It is therefore crucial for flying insects to detect and respond to an encountered odor plume before the fly's position drifts relative to adjacent plumes . We showed that Drosophila's early olfactory system signals the acceleration of odor concentrations to higher brain centers . This encoding mechanism allows an animal to detect the odor onset at a very early phase ( Figure 4 )\", 'Therefore , it is tempting to speculate that the acceleration encoding has evolved in Drosophila to maximize its chance to locate the odor source in a turbulent environment . It has also been shown that fruit flies can respond to the spatial difference of the odor concentration between two antennae in both walking and flight ( Duistermars et al . , 2009; Gaudry et al . , 2013 )', 'However , even with the lack of spatial sampling ability , fruit fly larvae can locate an odor source , based on the temporal sampling of odor gradients ( Louis et al . , 2008 )', 'Therefore , adult fruit flies may rely on both spatial and temporal sampling methods to locate an odor source , although their relative importance may vary depending on the locomotive state , as Reynolds numbers are different between walking and flight . \\n We built a precise and versatile odor delivery system ( Kim et al . , 2011 )', 'An odorant was diluted in dipropylene glycol , and 20 ml of the resulting mixture was put into a glass vial ( 30 ml ) and subsequently sealed by a screw cap with a silicone septa . Inlet and outlet needles were inserted into the vial headspace', 'The saturated vapor in this headspace was puffed by directing a low-flow air stream ( ≤100 ml/min ) from an air cylinder ( UN1002; TechAir , White Plains , NY ) into the odor vial by opening inlet and outlet solenoid valves ( Series 10; Parker-Hannifin Corporation , Cleveland , OH )', 'Subsequently , the outlet needle carried the saturated vapor from inside the vial to a custom laminar mixer where the odor flow was combined with a strong carrier flow ( 800 ml/min ) . The mixer was carefully designed so as to minimize the turbulence that could be formed when the low-flow odor stream is added to a high-flow-rate carrier stream', 'The output of the mixer was then directed to the antennae and maxillary palps of a prepared animal through a glass capillary ( 1 mm inner diameter ) . The interval between two consecutive puffs was between 45 s and 70 s depending on the amount of vapor consumed in each puff , and the mixture was replenished about every 10 trials', 'All flows were electronically controlled by a miniature pressure controller ( VSO-EP; Parker-Hannifin , OH ) and measured using a digital flow meter ( PV9000; Key Instruments , Trevose , PA ) in real time . After hitting the animal , the odor flow was immediately sucked into a probe and measured by a photoionization detector ( PID; Aurora Scientific , Canada ) with 1 l/min flow rate', 'The output of the PID was digitally sampled at 10 kHz and later advanced by 2 ms in order to compensate for the latency caused by the suction probe', 'In order to convert the PID output voltage into the odor concentration in parts per million ( ppm ) , we regularly ( every 10 trials ) measured the output of the PID with a calibration odor ( 3% propylene ) and estimated the general sensitivity of the PID , which gradually decays over time', 'The PID sensitivity ratio of actual odor to standard odor was measured in a separate experiment with a fully saturated odor vapor and used to calculate a scaling factor between the PID output ( in Volts ) and the absolute odor concentration ( in ppm ) ( Kim et al . , 2011 )', 'Drosophila stocks were maintained at room temperature on a 12-hr light/12-hr dark schedule and kept in standard plastic vials containing a cornmeal agar medium . All experiments were carried out with female flies of the NP3062-GAL4/NP3062-GAL4;UAS-mCD8::GFP/UAS-mCD8::GFP;+/+ genotype . NP3062-GAL flies were kindly provided by Kei Ito', 'Female flies 2–5 days posteclosion were used for both OSN and PN recordings . For the OSN recordings , single basiconic sensilla were targeted with electrolytically sharpened tungsten electrodes to measure the aggregate electrical activity of OSNs housed in these sensilla ( Figure 1B ) ( Kim et al . , 2011 )', 'Recordings were analyzed by a custom MATLAB code ( Source code 1 ) to sort out action potentials from Or59b or Or7a OSNs ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . For the PN recordings , a female fly was gently immobilized beneath a cellulose acetate film with an adhesive ( Datta et al . , 2008 ) . The film was then carefully transferred to a petri dish in which a circular hole was made at the center', 'When placing an animal in the hole , the location of the head was carefully adjusted so that the antennae and maxillary pals were located strictly within the odor stream between the odor delivery tubing and the suction probe , both of which were embedded in the petri dish', 'Antennal lobes were exposed by gently removing a head cuticle as well as the film under saline solution containing 108 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl2 , 8 . 2 mM MgCl2 , 4 mM NaHCO3 , 1 mM NaH2PO4 , 5 mM trehalose , 10 mM sucrose , and 5 mM HEPES ( pH , 7 . 5; 265 mOsm ) ( Wang et al . , 2003 )', 'In order to access the PN somas , the perineural sheath was weakened by a 1–2 min treatment with 1 mg/ml collagenase ( Type I Collagenase; Sigma–Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . The dorsal part of the sheath was then gently ruptured by a sharp quartz glass electrode using a micromanipulator ( MP-285; Sutter Instrument , Novato , CA )', 'A ground electrode was placed into the saline solution and connected to a headstage amplifier ( CV-7B; Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA )', 'In order to record action potentials of a single PN , a borosilicate patch electrode ( 7–10 MΩ tip resistance ) filled with saline solution was attached to the target cell and gentle suction was applied through the electrode capillary until a loose seal ( 50–100 MΩ ) was formed . The current was amplified ( MultiClamp 700B; Molecular Devices , CA ) , low-pass filtered at 1', '2 kHz , sampled at 10 kHz ( Digidata 1322A; Axon Instruments ) , and stored on a computer by software ( Clampex; Molecular Devices , CA ) . The animal was alive and active for a few hours as indicated by the spontaneous extension of its legs . Fresh oxygenated saline solution was perfused throughout the experiment', 'Finally , the PNs innervating the DM4 and DL5 glomeruli were identified by genetic means , using an enhancer trap line expressing Green Fluorescent Protein ( GFP ) in these cells . The identity of recorded cells was further verified by their odor response and the location of the soma in the dorsal cluster of the antennal lobe', 'Spike sequences were detected and sorted offline using custom software ( Source code 1 ) , written in MATLAB ( MathWorks , Natick , MA ) . Spike rates of OSNs and PNs were estimated by constructing a peristimulus–time histogram ( PSTH ) with a 100-ms bin size and a 75-ms overlap between adjacent bins', 'For the correlation analysis and 2D model prediction , the rate of change and acceleration components of odor and OSN traces were estimated by a forward difference equation , with the difference time interval as the scaling factor; for example , dxdt=[x ( t−Δ ) −x ( t ) ]/Δ , where x represents either the odor concentration or the OSN response , and Δ denotes the time interval', 'The time interval was 50 ms for the odor rate of change , 100 ms for odor acceleration , the OSN rate of change and OSN acceleration . Since the output of the forward difference equation is sensitive to high-frequency components of the signal , we low-pass filtered the amplitude and rate-of-change signals before deriving the rate of change and acceleration , respectively', 'Cut-off frequencies of the low-pass filters were 20 Hz for the odor amplitude , 10 Hz for the odor rate of change , 4 Hz for the OSN spike rate , and 4 Hz for the OSN rate of change', 'The cross-correlation coefficient , ϱ ( x , y ) between an input x and the corresponding output y was computed as a normalized cross-covariance function; that is , ϱ ( x , y ) =1N∑i=1N ( x[i]−μx ) ( y[i]−μy ) σxσy , where μ and σ are , respectively , the mean and standard deviation of the variable in the subscript .

      "\t ['The olfactory sense detects a plethora of behaviorally relevant odor molecules; gene families involved in olfaction exhibit high diversity in different animal phyla . Insects detect volatile molecules using olfactory ( OR ) or ionotropic receptors ( IR ) and in some cases gustatory receptors ( GRs )', 'While IRs are expressed in olfactory organs across Protostomia , ORs have been hypothesized to be an adaptation to a terrestrial insect lifestyle . We investigated the olfactory system of the primary wingless bristletail Lepismachilis y-signata ( Archaeognatha ) , the firebrat Thermobia domestica ( Zygentoma ) and the neopteran leaf insect Phyllium siccifolium ( Phasmatodea )', 'ORs and the olfactory coreceptor ( Orco ) are with very high probability lacking in Lepismachilis; in Thermobia we have identified three Orco candidates , and in Phyllium a fully developed OR/Orco-based system . We suggest that ORs did not arise as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle , but evolved later in insect evolution , with Orco being present before the appearance of ORs', 'All living organisms , including bacteria , protozoans , fungi , plants , and animals , detect chemicals in their environment . The sensitivity and chemical range of animal olfactory systems is remarkable , enabling animals to detect and discriminate between thousands of different odor molecules', 'Although there is a striking evolutionary convergence towards a conserved organization of signaling pathways in vertebrate and invertebrate olfactory systems ( Hildebrand and Shepherd , 1997 ) , the involved receptor gene families evolved independently . The molecular identity of olfactory receptors was first unraveled in vertebrates ( Buck and Axel , 1991 )', 'In mammals , as many as 1000 heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein ( or G protein ) -coupled receptors are considered to be employed in olfactory discrimination ( Buck and Axel , 1991 ) . A similar number of chemoreceptors , with about 1300 receptor genes and 400 pseudogenes , have been hypothesized for Caenorhabditis elegans ( Robertson and Thomas , 2006 )', 'All data on insect olfactory receptors are based on studies investigating the neopteran insects ( overview of insect order relationship is given in Figure 1 ) . The identity of receptors involved in olfaction in the evolutionarily more ancient apterygote insects ( Archaeognatha , Zygentoma ) and paleopteran insects ( Odonata and Ephemeroptera ) is thus completely unknown', 'In neopteran insects ( Polyneoptera , Paraneoptera , and Holometabola ) most volatile stimuli are recognized by members of the olfactory receptor family ( ORs ) . ORs are multitransmembrane domain proteins unrelated to nematode or vertebrate olfactory receptors ( Mombaerts , 1999; Robertson , 2001; Hill et al . , 2002 ) , displaying a distinct membrane topology ( Benton et al', ', 2006; Lundin et al . , 2007 ) . The number of functional OR genes varies from 10 in the human body louse Pediculus humanus humanus ( Kirkness et al . , 2010 ) to about 60 in Drosophila melanogaster ( Clyne et al . , 1999; Gao and Chess , 1999; Vosshall et al . , 1999 ) and up to 350 OR genes in ants ( Zhou et al . , 2012 )', 'ORs have been suggested to be distantly related to the gustatory receptors of arthropods , with some proteins containing a signature motif in the carboxyl terminus ( Scott et al . , 2001 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02115 . 003Figure 1 .

All orders investigated in this study are labeled by an asterisk . Our data suggests the evolution of the coreceptor Orco after the bristletails split from its last common ancestor with the remaining insects', 'However , an olfactory system that relies both on ORs and Orco seems to have evolved after the emergence of wings . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02115 . 003 Insect olfactory receptors function as heteromultimers composed of at least one ligand-specific OR and the coreceptor Orco ( Vosshall et al . , 1999; Elmore et al . , 2003; Krieger et al . , 2003; Larsson et al', ', 2004; Sato et al . , 2008; Wicher et al . , 2008 ) . Interestingly , while Orco ( Vosshall and Hansson , 2011 ) is highly conserved among insects , the sequences of other olfactory receptor genes exhibit very little sequence similarity even within the same insect order ( Krieger et al . , 2003 ) , complicating their identification', 'So far , Orco homologues have been identified in Lepidoptera , Diptera , Coleoptera , Hymenoptera , Hemiptera ( Krieger et al . , 2003; Pitts et al . , 2004; Smadja et al . , 2009 ) , and Orthoptera ( Yang et al . , 2012 ) . Neither Orco nor ORs are present in the genome of the crustacean Daphnia pulex , indicating that ORs are insect specific', 'However , GRs were found in Crustacea , just as in insects ( Peñalva-Arana et al . , 2009 ) . A second receptor family , the variant ionotropic glutamate receptors ( IRs ) , is also involved in insect chemosensation ( Benton et al . , 2009 )', 'IRs act in combinations of up to three subunits; individual odor-specific receptors and one or two of the broadly expressed coreceptors IR25a , IR8a , and IR76b ( Abuin et al . , 2011 ) . IRs are present in olfactory tissues across the Protostomia ( Croset et al . , 2010 ) , for example two conserved members of this group were described in the Daphnia genome ( Croset et al', ', 2010 ) and the coreceptor IR25a homologue is expressed in many , if not all mature OSNs of the American lobster Homarus americanus ( Hollins et al . , 2003 ) and the spiny lobster Panulirus argus ( Tadesse et al . , 2011 ) . Since crustaceans are the closest relatives of insects ( Friedrich and Tautz , 1995; Boore et al . , 1998; Regier et al', ', 2010 ) , IRs are most likely the ancient type of insect olfactory receptor . But when and why did insect ORs evolve ? Hexapods derived from an aquatic crustacean ancestor , probably in the Early Ordovician , approximately 483 mya ( Rota-Stabelli et al . , 2013 ) . The transition from sea to land meant that molecules needed to be detected in gas phase instead of aquatic solution', 'Therefore , the olfactory system of a hexapod ancestor had to adapt to the terrestrial conditions and detection of volatile , air-borne chemicals . One proposed hypothesis has been that Orco and ORs of the insect type are an adaptation to this terrestrial lifestyle ( Robertson et al . , 2003; Krång et al . , 2012 )', 'To reconstruct an evolutionary scenario for insect ORs , we investigated species belonging to different ancient insect orders , including Archaeognatha ( jumping bristletails ) and Zygentoma ( silverfishes and firebrats ) , and a neopteran insect belonging to the Phasmatodea ( leaf and stick insects ) as so far not analyzed control group using morphological , electrophysiological and molecular techniques', 'On the antennae of L . y-signata the only putative olfactory sensilla were porous olfactory basiconic sensilla ( Figure 2B–E ) . These sensilla were arranged in a pattern that is highly stereotypical between antennal modules composed of 5–12 annuli , with annuli typically containing zero-to-four Sensilla basiconica ( Missbach et al . , 2011 )', 'Responses to all tested chemical classes of odors , including acids , alcohols , aldehydes , esters , and ketones , were recorded from OSNs housed in these sensilla using the single sensillum recoding measurements ( SSR ) ( Figure 3 , uppermost heat map )', 'Based on the response profile , spontaneous activity , and colocalization inside the same sensillum , we identified 12 OSN types , present in five functional basiconic sensillum types . Out of the 12 OSN types , only seven responded to odors tested; two exclusively to acids , while five responded with a similar activity rate to acids or amines and to other odors', 'OSNs belonging to this second class were broadly tuned and exhibited relatively low spiking activity . In general , OSN classes displayed a low baseline activity with about 1 to 7 spikes/s , with Lys-ab2A that had a spontaneous activity of more than 25 spikes/s as the only exception', 'Only rarely was an increase in spiking rate of more than 60 spikes per second recorded , even for the best identified ligands ( Figure 3—source data 1 ) . No responses were obtained for ammonia or pyridine', 'Coeloconic-like sensilla , s-shaped trichoid sensilla , and chaetic sensilla did not display any morphological features indicating olfactory function and did also not respond to any odor tested ( Missbach et al . , 2011; data not shown ) .

This species collection provides an excellent model to study the early evolution of the insect olfactory system', 'To address which receptors are involved in odor detection in these insects and in basal insects in general , we applied several different approaches', 'Based on our transcriptome data sets , we suggest a stepwise evolution of the Orco/OR complex with Orco having evolved in the lineage of Dicondylia ( Zygentoma + Pterygota ) and the functional complex of Orco and ORs emerging within the pterygote insects ( this study , Clyne et al . , 1999; Gao and Chess , 1999; Smadja et al . , 2009; Vosshall et al', ', 1999; Robertson and Wanner , 2006; Kirkness et al . , 2010 ) . Although it is impossible to completely rule out the presence of ORs , none of our extensive experiments led to the identification of either ORs or Orco in the bristletail L . y-signata . The well-established conservation of the Orco coding gene through evolution suggests that it is highly unlikely that we missed it', 'We did , however , identify a number of IRs , including the IR coreceptors IR25a , IR8a , and IR76b in the L . y-signata antennal transcriptome . FISH allowed us to visualize expression of the IR co-receptors in a large number of OSNs associated with basiconic sensilla . Based on these results we propose that the olfactory system of L . y-signata is not based on ORs', 'In insects , different sensillum types house OSNs typically responding to different sets of odors . In D . melanogaster IRs are the functional receptor type of OSNs in double-walled coeloconic sensilla , and ORs are predominantly expressed in OSNs housed in single-walled basiconic and trichoid sensilla ( Hallem et al . , 2004; Silbering et al . , 2011 )', 'It follows that this organization cannot exist with just one sensillum type present , as is the case in Archaeognatha ( Berg and Schmidt , 1997; Missbach et al . , 2011 ) and older hexapod taxa as the Collembola ( Altner and Prillinger , 1980 )', 'The oldest insect taxon where double-walled sensilla were investigated is Zygentoma , which have both single-walled basiconic sensilla with pores and double-walled sensilla with spoke channels ( Berg and Schmidt , 1997 ) . Coeloconic sensilla differ dramatically from the single-walled trichoid and basiconic types in both wall structure and in internal environment', 'The coeloconic structure has been thought to be a prerequisite for IR function ( Benton et al . , 2009; Guo et al . , 2014 ) . However , in the Archaeognatha we find that IRs are most likely located in OSNs of Sensilla basiconica . IRs might thus have evolved in a single-walled sensillum and did not find their modern , coeloconic environment until neopteran insects evolved . In the bristletail L', 'y-signata , we found that many of the OSNs are very broadly tuned , responding to volatiles with several different functional groups at higher doses . However , broadly tuned receptors might not have high affinities . By counting and integrating molecules over longer times , OSNs could include even low-probability binding events in generating their response ( Firestein , 2001 )', 'This might also mean that the system does not have a high temporal resolution , which seems to be a fair trade-off for a walking insect that lives in its substrate . The response spectrum of Drosophila IRs is much narrower than the responses we find in the bristletail', 'If IRs are the only olfactory receptor type in basal insects they should exhibit a broader spectrum of possible ligands , including acids , aldehydes , alcohols , but also esters and ketones , as revealed in our physiological measurements . One additional observation in the bristletail is that many of those neurons have a broad overlap in their response spectra', 'One hypothesis to explain an IR-based olfactory system in L . y-signata would be very broad tuning of single receptors , another that the selectivity of OSNs could be regulated by combinations of different IRs . In D . melanogaster , one conserved IR ( IR64a ) is expressed in different subpopulations of sensilla in the third chamber of the sacculus ( Silbering et al . , 2011 )', 'Corresponding OSNs are activated either by free protons or organic acids and many other odors , including esters , alcohols , and ketones ( Ai et al . , 2010 )', 'Expression of this IR together with IR8a is both necessary and sufficient for sensitivity towards organic acids and other odors , but probably requires a different , until now unknown cofactor to mediate the specific response of OSNs to inorganic acids and CO2 ( Ai et al . , 2010 )', 'Alternatively , GR candidates could account for part of the non-neopteran olfactory setup , especially since it has been shown that GRs can add to the olfactory repertoire ( Tauxe et al . , 2013 ) . Putative contact chemosensory sensilla are highly abundant on the antennae of L . y-signata ( Missbach et al . , 2011 ) and T . domestica ( Adel , 1984 )', 'Both detection of sugars/amino acids ( shown for T . domestica: Hansen-Delkeskamp , 2001 ) and a proposed contact-pheromone ( Fröhlich and Lu , 2013 ) likely involve GRs , indicating that involvement of the limited set of GRs beyond this scope is unlikely . However , these data do not explain the presence of three different Orco variants in the firebrat', 'So far only one Orco orthologue has been identified in each studied insect species ( e . g . , Krieger et al . , 2003; Pitts et al . , 2004; Smadja et al . , 2009; Yang et al . , 2012 ) . All T . domestica variants were found to be expressed in antennae , suggesting their involvement in chemosensation', 'TdomOrco3 even has an amino acid exchange of a functional important residue from asparagine to glutamic acid at position 466 . This residue was demonstrated as critical for the ion channel function in D', 'melanogaster , where substitution of D466 with amino acids other than glutamic acid resulted in a substantial reduction in channel activity , but substitution to glutamic acid leads to an increase in sensitivity of the heteromeric receptor complex ( Kumar et al . , 2013 ) . Additionally , this residue is highly conserved across insects ( Kumar et al . , 2013 ) including two of the three T', 'domestica Orcos ( this study ) . While the antennal expression argues for a potential involvement in chemosensation , the existence of three Orco types remains mysterious', 'It will be part of future studies to investigate if the Orco candidates form heterodimers with other receptors like GRs or with each other to build functional receptors or if they fulfill a channel function in other processes than olfaction', 'Altogether our data suggests that ORs evolved in insects after the emergence of Archaeognatha and Zygentoma , and therefore long after insects transitioned to a terrestrial lifestyle . At the time when flying insects occurred , the vegetation on earth was rapidly spreading and diversifying', 'ORs might not only increase the diversity of detected chemicals , but also allow the olfactory system to rapidly assess airborne odors . This is especially important for insects for which stimulus contact is very short and a fast response time is critical ( Getahun et al . , 2012 )', 'The oldest flying insect orders Odonta ( dragonflies and damselflies ) and Ephemeroptera ( mayflies ) were traditionally considered to be anosmic , lacking both a glomerular antennal lobe and mushroom body calyces ( Strausfeld et al . , 1998; Farris , 2005 ) . Recent studies have shown that at least dragonflies have an aerial sense of smell ( Rebora et al . , 2012 )', 'However the small antennae and the low number of olfactory sensilla will make it even more challenging to identify putative ORs and Orco in antennal transcriptomes . ORs were definitely present in the last common ancestor of ‘hemi’- and holometabolan insects at least 318–300 million years ago , with Orco present in both groups ( this study , Krieger et al . , 2003; Pitts et al', ', 2004; Smadja et al . , 2009; Yang et al . 2012 ) . The increasing dispersion of vascular plants together with the development of wings and a secondary wing articulation opened new and wider ranges of habitats and ecological niches for insects and the receptors to find them . \\n Different stages and sexes of Lepismachilis y-signata were collected at several locations around Jena ( Germany )', 'Animals were kept under normal light conditions and room temperature , in plastic boxes with paper towel on the ground , covered with bark with lichens , dried grassroots , and dead leaves of maple ( Acer campestre , Sapindaceae ) .

      "\t ['Splitting sensory information into parallel pathways is a common strategy in sensory systems . Yet , how circuits in these parallel pathways are composed to maintain or even enhance the encoding of specific stimulus features is poorly understood', 'Here , we have investigated the parallel pathways formed by mitral and tufted cells of the olfactory system in mice and characterized the emergence of feature selectivity in these cell types via distinct lateral inhibitory circuits', 'We find differences in activity-dependent lateral inhibition between mitral and tufted cells that likely reflect newly described differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells', 'Simulations show that these circuit-level differences allow mitral and tufted cells to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges , indicating that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways . \\n Brain sensory systems use parallel pathways to encode different components of sensory information', 'Motion and color are segregated in the visual system ( Merigan and Maunsell , 1993;\\xa0Callaway , 2005 ) , sound location and tonal pattern are processed in parallel pathways in the auditory system ( Lomber and Malhotra , 2008 ) , and pain and itch are conveyed by distinct pathways in the somatosensory system ( Davidson and Giesler , 2010; Ross , 2011 )', 'How local circuits support feature selectivity in these parallel streams remains poorly understood . This issue is of particular interest when considering brain areas in which distinct outputs are generated from initially homogeneous sources , such as in the olfactory system', 'In the mammalian olfactory bulb , firing of olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs ) excites two classes of projection neurons – mitral cells and tufted cells ( MCs and TCs ) . While long viewed as essentially equivalent neuron classes , emerging evidence shows that MCs and TCs exhibit distinct activity in vivo ( Nagayama et al . , 2004; Fukunaga et al . , 2012; Igarashi et al . , 2012; Adam et al', ', 2014; Otazu et al . , 2015 ) , suggesting that MCs and TCs encode complementary aspects of olfactory information . For instance , TCs respond to lower odor concentrations than MCs ( Igarashi et al . , 2012; Kikuta et al . , 2013 ) , suggesting that TCs are involved in processing near-threshold stimuli', 'Consistent with this notion of parallel pathways , MCs and TCs project their axons to many non-overlapping regions ( Nagayama et al . , 2010; Igarashi et al . , 2012 ) . Recent work has begun to explore the circuit-level origins of these functional differences in odor-evoked activity', 'For instance , TCs are more intrinsically excitable and receive stronger OSN-mediated excitation than MCs ( Gire et al . , 2012; Burton and Urban , 2014 ) . Whether other elements of the olfactory bulb circuit account for differences in MC vs . TC odor-evoked activity is unknown', 'Throughout the brain , lateral inhibitory circuits enhance contrast and facilitate discrimination of similar stimuli by decorrelating neural responses ( Hirsch and Gilbert , 1991; Urban , 2002; Gschwend et al . , 2015 )', 'In the olfactory bulb , lateral inhibition occurs between pairs of MCs or TCs via reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with inhibitory granule cells ( GCs ) ( Schoppa and Urban , 2003; Egger and Urban , 2006 ) . Previously , we have shown that lateral inhibition most strongly affects MCs firing at intermediate rates because coincident input is required for the activation of GCs ( Arevian et al', ', 2008 ) . This activity-dependent regulation of the strength of lateral inhibition onto MCs decorrelates MC responses to similar input more effectively than subtractive or divisive forms of inhibition ( Arevian et al . , 2008 )', 'Lateral inhibition onto TCs is largely unexplored , but the marked differences in MC and TC odor-evoked activity suggest that lateral inhibition onto TCs may operate differently . Here , we show that optogenetic activation of a single , gene-targeted glomerulus elicits larger and more asynchronous lateral inhibitory currents in nearby MCs than in TCs', 'Moreover , this same photostimulation paradigm inhibits spiking differently in MCs and TCs . While MCs are affected by lateral inhibition at intermediate firing rates ( ~50\\u2009Hz ) , TCs are affected when firing at low firing rates ( <25Hz ) . This difference arises , in part , due to differential recruitment of morphologically distinct classes of GCs by MCs and TCs', 'Finally , we use simulations to explore how these circuit-level differences between MCs and TCs influence odor discrimination', 'Specifically , the combination of activity-dependent lateral inhibition at both low and intermediate rates enables TCs and MCs to collectively encode odors better than either population alone and supports novel computations that are unlikely to occur with a single neuron type', 'To analyze lateral inhibition , we optically activated M72-expressing OSN axons in acute slices from M72-ChR2-YFP mice ( Smear et al . , 2013 ) while recording from MCs or TCs innervating nearby glomeruli ( Figure 1a , b )', 'This approach allows specific and selective activation of a single , genetically-identified glomerulus across animals , eliminating an important potential source of variability . MCs and TCs showed reliable lateral inhibition following a 10 ms light pulse ( Figure 1c , d ) , and similar proportions of MCs ( 10/17–59% ) and TCs ( 9/15–60% ) received lateral inhibitory currents', 'The MCs and TCs recorded were similar distances from the M72 glomerulus , and lateral inhibition did not vary within this limited range of distances in either MCs or TCs ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 )', 'To examine early and late components of the inhibitory responses onto MCs and TCs , we separated early ( <250 ms after stimulation ) and late ( >250 ms after photostimulation ) components of the inhibitory currents', 'The peak amplitude of early inhibition was larger in MCs than in TCs ( Figure 1e ) , while the charge transferred of early phase inhibition was not significantly different ( Figure 1f ) . Additionally , both the peak amplitude and charge transferred of late phase inhibition ( >250\\xa0ms ) was significantly larger in MCs than in TCs', 'MCs also receive a smaller proportion of total inhibition during the early phase than TCs , indicating that inhibition is more asynchronous onto MCs than onto TCs .

However , for MCs and TCs recorded in the same slice , the same relationships in peak amplitude and charge transferred for both early and late phase inhibition were observed as in the larger data set', 'Specifically , early and late phase peak amplitude , but only late phase charge transferred , was significantly higher in MCs than in TCs measured in the same slice ( Figure 1g ) . To confirm that these results are not specific to the M72 glomerulus , we performed an analogous experiment in OMP-ChR2-YFP mice ( Smear et al', ', 2011 ) by photostimulating a single unidentified glomerulus ( 100 ms pulses ) in the medial olfactory bulb ( Figure 1h–i ) . Previously we have shown that we can limit photostimulation to single glomeruli in OMP-ChR2-YFP mice ( Burton and Urban , 2015 )', 'Similar to the results obtained using M72-ChR2-YFP mice , we find that only the peak amplitude of the early phase of inhibition is larger in MCs while both the amplitude and charge transferred of the late phase of inhibition are larger in MCs ( Figure 1j , k ) . Together these two experiments indicate that lateral inhibition is larger and more asynchronous onto MCs than onto TCs', 'Finally , using photostimulation of a single glomerulus in OMP-ChR2-YFP mice , we tested whether GCs contribute similar proportions of lateral inhibition onto MCs and TCs using a previously described strategy ( Najac et al . , 2015 ) to differentiate between GC- vs . non-GC-mediated inhibition onto MCs and TCs', 'We recorded lateral inhibition before and after limiting GC-mediated inhibition by bath applying NMDAR antagonist APV ( 25\\u2009μM ) and mGluR antagonist LY36785 ( 100\\u2009μM ) . Using this pharmacological approach , we found that GCs contribute similar proportions of lateral inhibition onto MCs and TCs ( Figure 1l )', 'Additionally , in MCs and TCs in which the apical dendrite had been truncated , all lateral inhibition was blocked after limiting GC-mediated inhibition ( Figure 1i , l ) . In contrast , small inhibitory currents remained after limiting GC-mediated inhibition in MCs and TCs with intact apical dendrites ( Figure 1i , l )', 'Removing cells with cut apical dendrites and redoing the analysis presented in Figure 1l similarly shows that GCs contribute similar proportions of lateral inhibition onto MCs and TCs', 'These observations indicate that glomerular layer circuits make small and uniform contributions to lateral inhibition in MCs and TCs and thus are not the primary source of differences in lateral inhibition between MCs and TCs . We next explored how lateral inhibition influences MC and TC spiking', 'To do this , we stimulated MCs and TCs by step current injection and measured firing rates to construct input-output curves in cells near the M72 glomerulus . On interleaved trials we activated M72 OSN axons via photostimulation ( Figures 2 , 3 ) . We used a duration of step current injection matching the physiological duration of firing observed following in vivo\\xa0odor delivery ( Patterson et al', ', 2013 ) or in vitro\\xa0glomerular activation ( Najac et al . , 2015 ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . Similar proportions of MCs ( 16/25–64% ) and TCs ( 12/18–67% ) were affected by lateral inhibition ( see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods ) , and unaffected cells were excluded from further analysis . Additionally , MCs and TCs were similar distances from the M72 glomerulus ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 )', 'Similar to our previous results using paired MC recordings ( Arevian et al . , 2008 ) , MC firing rates were reduced by lateral inhibition selectively when MCs fired at intermediate rates , although inhibition was observed at more than double the rate observed in paired recordings . For example , the MC in Figure 2b , e was affected by lateral inhibition while firing between 27–76\\u2009Hz', 'Likewise , across a population of 16 MCs , rates between 34 ± 11\\u2009Hz and 79 ± 22\\u2009Hz were affected by lateral inhibition ( Figure 3a–e , Figure 3—figure supplement 2a–c ) .

Additionally , these effects of lateral inhibition on firing rate were present even in short timescales matching a single 4\\u2009Hz sniff ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 )', 'Collectively , our results demonstrate that lateral inhibition is functionally distinct in MCs and TCs . This difference in activity-dependent lateral inhibition ( ADLI ) may arise from differences in the lateral inhibitory circuits engaged by MCs and TCs', 'Our finding that inhibition is largely unaffected by apical dendrite truncation suggests that differences in ADLI between MCs and TCs most likely involves inhibitory circuitry within the external plexiform layer ( EPL )', 'Consistent with MCs and TCs engaging distinct lateral inhibitory circuits within the EPL , classical morphological studies suggest that GCs are subdivided into superficial GCs ( sGCs ) , which innervate the superficial EPL , and deep GCs ( dGCs ) , which innervate the deep EPL ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al . , 1983 )', 'This putative morphological subdivision of GCs suggests that sGCs inhibit TC lateral dendrites in the superficial EPL while dGCs inhibit MC lateral dendrites in the deep EPL ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al . , 1984 ) . Therefore , functional differences between sGCs and dGCs may mechanistically underlie the difference in ADLI observed between MCs and TCs', 'In particular , given our prior results demonstrating that low firing rates in MCs are unaffected by lateral inhibition because many GCs require cooperative inputs from multiple glomeruli in order to be activated ( Arevian et al', ', 2008 ) , we hypothesized that low firing rates in TCs are affected by lateral inhibition because sGCs are more strongly recruited than dGCs following activation of a single glomerulus . Several previous findings are consistent with this hypothesis . GC soma position correlates with GC subtype ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al', ', 1983 ) and odor-evoked activity in vivo ( Wellis and Scott , 1990 ) . Specifically , GCs located in the MCL and upper GCL tend to exhibit sGC morphologies and suprathreshold odor responses while GCs located in the lower GCL tend to exhibit dGC morphologies and subthreshold odor responses ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al . , 1983; Wellis and Scott , 1990 )', 'Whether these differences in odor-evoked activity in vivo\\xa0reflect functional differences between GC subtypes and M/TC connectivity remains unclear , however , as: 1 ) odors activate multiple glomeruli in distinct spatiotemporal patterns , which can evoke a complex array of convergent excitation and inhibition onto individual GCs ( Burton and Urban , 2015 ) , and 2 ) GC activity in vivo\\xa0is strongly influenced by centrifugal input ( Balu et al', ', 2007; Boyd et al . , 2012; Markopoulos et al . , 2012 ) and anesthesia ( Kato et al . , 2012; Cazakoff et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , to more directly test our above hypothesis , we recorded the excitatory synaptic input and spiking response of GCs to activation of single nearby glomeruli , with post-hoc recovery of Neurobiotin-filled cell morphologies', 'For this experiment , we switched from selective optogenetic stimulation of M72 glomeruli to extracellular stimulation of untagged glomeruli in order to test a large number of GC-glomerulus pairs', 'While this approach introduces a degree of glomerulus-to-glomerulus variability to our data , we capitalized on the well-established all-or-none nature of glomerular activation at low stimulation intensities ( Carlson et al . , 2000; Gire and Schoppa , 2009 ) to enable across-cell comparisons of synaptic input and spiking responses following glomerular activation', 'In addition , we and others have previously demonstrated that optogenetic photostimulation and extracellular stimulation of OSN axons trigger comparable sensory-evoked input to both M/TCs and GCs ( Gire et al . , 2012; Burton and Urban , 2014 , 2015 ) . Consistent with previous morphological accounts ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al', ', 1983 ) , GCs exhibited distinct sGC or dGC morphologies upon visual inspection ( Figure 4a , d; Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Indeed , reconstruction and visual classification of a large subset of recorded GCs and analysis of the spatial distribution of gemmules – the site of reciprocal dendrodendritic synapse formation ( Rall et al', ', 1966 ) – confirmed that sGCs preferentially innervate the superficial EPL while dGCs preferentially innervate the deep EPL ( Figure 4g ) . Moreover , somatic depth significantly – but incompletely – predicted GC subtype ( Figure 4a , d; Figure 4—figure supplement 1; Figure 4—source data 1 , Table 1 ) , as previously observed ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al . , 1983 )', 'To determine whether the observed morphological differences reflect subtypes of GCs rather than a continuum , we additionally performed unbiased clustering of GCs', 'Specifically , clustering of GCs by the Euclidean distances among their normalized gemmule distributions ( using Ward’s method ) and application of the gap statistic method yielded 3 distinct clusters: dGCs , sGCs , and a small group of sGCs with prominent innervation of the deep glomerular layer ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1c )', 'Moreover , these clusters closely aligned with our original classification by visual inspection , with 19 of 19 sGCs and 9 of 11 dGCs correctly assigned ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1c ) .

Critically , recordings of spontaneous synaptic activity were performed in the absence of TTX and thus contain some degree of action potential-dependent input , which likely originates from intact presynaptic cells', 'Therefore , equal spontaneous event frequencies between sGCs and dGCs suggests that their respective presynaptic circuits are comparably intact . Moreover , equal spontaneous event amplitudes suggest a comparable contribution of larger action potential-dependent and smaller action potential-independent events between sGCs and dGCs , again consistent with comparably intact presynaptic circuits', 'In total , our results thus support the hypothesis sGCs are more strongly recruited than dGCs following activation of a single glomerulus due to stronger excitatory input and greater intrinsic excitability , although we cannot rule out an important role for other mechanisms , especially in the intact system in vivo', 'As an additional test of our hypothesis that differences in the excitability of GCs provide one potential mechanism underlying the functional difference in ADLI between MCs and TCs , we measured the effects of lateral inhibition on MC spiking before and after increasing the excitability of GCs with the mGluR agonist ( RS ) -3 , 5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ( DHPG , 10 µM ) ( Dong et al', ', 2007; Heinbockel et al . , 2007 ) . At this concentration , DHPG selectively enhances the excitability of GCs ( Heinbockel et al . , 2004 ) but not MCs ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 )', 'The effective activity range of lateral inhibition in MCs ( n=6 ) fell from 31 ( ± 9 ) –73 ( ± 10 ) Hz to 16 ( ± 12 ) –49 ( ± 23 ) Hz after adding DHPG ( Figure 5a–d ) , and the lower and upper bounds of the effective activity range of lateral inhibition were significantly reduced after the addition of DHPG ( Figure 5e )', 'Additionally , these effects did not depend on whether apical dendrites were intact ( Figure 5d ) , and therefore does not reflect effects of DHPG on glomerular layer circuitry .

In this simulation , each MC or TC received excitatory input from one of the 150 glomeruli . On each trial , we randomly presented one odor from the panel to networks comprised entirely of either MCs or TCs', 'We applied a common decoding algorithm , linear discriminant analysis , to determine the extent to which different odors were discriminable in our simulated MC and TC populations ( Figure 6c )', 'While the strategy that downstream brain areas use to decode information contained in MC and TC outputs is unknown , linear discriminant analysis is a simple classification algorithm , has some degree of biological plausibility and has been widely applied in similar contexts ( Quiroga et al . , 2007; Quian Quiroga and Panzeri , 2009; Giridhar et al . , 2011 )', 'We first compared the discrimination accuracy of three models: one in which ADLI affected low rates ( i . e . an all TC network ) , one in which ADLI affected intermediate rates ( i . e . an all MC network ) , and a control population that lacked any inhibition', 'ADLI was modeled by explicitly adjusting the sensitivity of MC and TC firing rates to inhibition without changing other parameters of the model ( Figure 6d–e ) . When the odor panel consisted of only 8 odors , both MC and TC populations discriminated between odors with an accuracy that did not differ from the control population that lacked inhibition ( Figure 6f )', 'However , when we increased the difficulty of the task by increasing the size of the odor panel ( to 32 odors ) , the difference in accuracy between MCs and TCs dramatically increased ( Figure 6g )', 'For the set of 32 odors , TCs significantly outperformed MCs and the control population at low odor concentrations ( 90% accuracy in TCs compared to 70% accuracy in MCs at 30% of maximum concentration ) while MCs significantly outperformed TCs and the control population at high concentrations ( 73% accuracy in TCs compared to 91% accuracy in MCs at 60% of maximum concentration )', 'Therefore , differences in ADLI alone support concentration-dependent differences in odor discrimination . Next we tested how well different forms of activity-independent inhibition compare to ADLI in their ability to improve discrimination accuracy', 'Specifically , we compared discrimination accuracy ( in panels consisting of 32 odors ) between 3 populations of neurons; one with subtractive inhibition ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2a ) , one with divisive inhibition ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2b ) and a control population that lacked inhibition', 'We found that populations using subtractive or divisive inhibition performed no better than the control population across all concentrations ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2c )', 'These results agree with prior work that showed that ADLI substantially decorrelates MC responses to similar odors while subtractive and divisive forms of lateral inhibition have little effect on MC correlation ( Arevian et al . , 2008 )', 'Prior work has shown that , in addition to ADLI differences , TCs are more intrinsically excitable ( Burton and Urban , 2014 ) and receive stronger OSN inputs than MCs ( Gire et al . , 2012; Burton and Urban , 2014 ) . Therefore , we next asked how well these differences between MCs and TCs affect odor discrimination', 'Differences in the strength of OSN input and intrinsic excitability were modeled by altering sigmoid functions that relate the intensity of glomerular inputs to M/TC outputs ( Figure 6h ) . These differences in MC vs . TC excitability and OSN input strength also allow TCs and MCs to discriminate odors best at low and high concentrations respectively ( Figure 6i )', 'Finally we simulated how all three differences between MCs and TCs – ADLI , intrinsic excitability and glomerular input –\\xa0affected odor concentration . Intriguingly , TCs were best at discriminating between low concentration odors when all three differences were included in the model ( Figure 6j )', 'Together , these simulations show that intrinsic and circuit-level differences between MCs and TCs work cooperatively to optimize discrimination between similar odors in separate concentration ranges . Finally , we asked more generally how sensory systems , including the olfactory system , might benefit from splitting information into multiple channels with distinct ADLI', 'First , we asked whether models containing a combination of MCs and TCs discriminate odors better than models that have only MCs or TCs . We used a variant of the models presented above: here , each glomerulus provided input to 2 neurons instead of 1', 'We compared three different output neuron configurations: 2 MCs per glomerulus , 2 TCs per glomerulus , and 1 MC and 1 TC per glomerulus ( Figure 6k , see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods ) . Similar to the data presented in Figure 6g , TC models discriminated between 32 odors best at low concentrations and MC models were best at high concentrations ( Figure 6l )', 'However , MC-TC models significantly outperformed other models at intervening odor concentrations', 'Interestingly , MC-TC models also exhibited the second best performance at high and low concentrations , and after averaging discrimination accuracy across all concentrations tested , we found that models containing a combination of MCs and TCs performed significantly better than models composed of only MCs or only TCs ( Figure 6m )', 'Second , new features might arise in any brain area that implements ADLI and splits information into parallel channels . Using an image processing analogy , we show that if an image is split into parallel channels and then recombined by a downstream population , new information about the image ( i . e . higher contrast ) , absent in either single channel , emerges ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 )', 'Therefore systems that split sensory information into multiple pathways can not only outperform single pathway systems at comparable tasks , but are also capable of performing novel computations unlikely to occur in single pathway systems . \\n Parallel pathways are a common feature of many sensory systems', 'Yet how local\\xa0circuit activity creates stimulus selectivity in parallel pathways remains poorly understood . Here , we have identified a novel circuit mechanism for generating differential responses across two parallel pathways ( formed by MCs and TCs ) in the olfactory system and examined the emergence of feature selectivity', 'We find that differences in ADLI selectively reduce intermediate firing rates in MCs and low firing rates in TCs . We provide evidence that these effects could be caused , in part , by differences in the excitability of subclasses of GCs that preferentially inhibit TCs vs . MCs', 'Moreover , using simulations , we show that differences in the effective activity range of lateral inhibition , along with other intrinsic and circuit-level differences between MCs and TCs , work cooperatively to enable MCs and TCs to best discriminate between similar odors in separate concentration ranges', \"Finally , we show that the combination of MCs and TCs facilitates odor discrimination across a wide range of odor concentrations . The activity-dependence of lateral inhibition depends on three cell populations – the 'presynaptic'\\xa0M/TCs associated with the M72 glomerulus ( which we activate optogenetically via stimulation of OSNs ) , the inhibitory interneurons and the 'postsynaptic' M/TCs\", 'Our prior work has shown that increasing the firing rate of presynaptic MCs ( the M72 MCs in this case ) shifts the range of MC firing rates influenced by lateral inhibition ( Arevian et al . , 2008 )', 'Given that TCs fire at higher rates than MCs following glomerular activation ( Burton and Urban , 2014 ) , M72 TCs will fire at higher rates than M72 MCs following M72 photoactivation and , in part , contribute to the decreased lower bound of the effective activity range of lateral inhibition in postsynaptic TCs', 'However , higher firing rates in M72 TCs alone is insufficient to explain the differences in both the lower and upper bound in the effective activity range of lateral inhibition between MCs and TCs . Our analysis supports the hypothesis that TCs and MCs are preferentially connected to sGCs and dGCs , respectively', 'Additionally , we provide indirect evidence that differences in the recruitability of sGCs and dGCs may be one potential mechanism underlying the differences in ADLI between MCs and TCs . Our data suggests that sGCs spike with a higher probability than dGCs following the activation of a single glomerulus', 'Consequently , postsynaptic TCs can effectively recruit lateral inhibition when firing at low rates . dGCs are less excitable and therefore require more input to be activated . Therefore M72 photostimulation alone causes relatively weak activation of dGCs . However , when the postsynaptic MC fires at intermediate rates , additional dGCs will become activated and mediate lateral inhibition', 'In support of this mechanism , we show that increasing the excitability of GCs by activating mGluRs ( Dong et al . , 2007; Heinbockel et al . , 2007 ) shifts the effective activity range of lateral inhibition in MCs to lower firing rates ( Figure 5 )', 'Additionally , these differences between sGCs and dGCs can explain why the upper bound on the effective activity range of lateral inhibition differs between MCs and TCs . Cells firing above this upper bound recruit the maximum amount of recurrent inhibition such that additional inputs to GCs cannot trigger additional GABA release ( Urban and Arevian , 2009 )', 'Because sGCs are more excitable than dGCs , maximal GABA release , and consequently the upper bound on the effective activity range of lateral inhibition , occurs at lower rates in TCs than in MCs ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 )', 'While preferential connectivity of TCs with sGCs and MCs with dGCs can explain the observed differences in the activity-dependence of lateral inhibition , other circuit mechanisms may also contribute . In particular , EPL interneurons ( EPL-INs ) can mediate inhibition onto M/TCs ( Huang et al . , 2013; Kato et al . , 2013; Miyamichi et al', ', 2013 ) , and it remains possible that EPL-INs or distinct subclasses of EPL-INs preferentially inhibit MCs or TCs . However , it is unlikely that EPL-INs predominantly drive the difference in MC vs . TC ADLI given that EPL-INs mediate linear ( divisive ) but not activity-dependent inhibition of MC/TC outputs ( Kato et al . , 2013; Uchida et al . , 2013 )', 'Glomerular layer circuits have also been shown to play a role in M/TC lateral inhibition ( Aungst et al . , 2003; Liu et al . , 2013; Whitesell et al . , 2013; Banerjee et al . , 2015 ) , however these circuits likely do not play a role in the differences in ADLI reported here because our results were not influenced by apical dendrite truncation', 'Therefore , distinct GC populations that differ in excitability are the most parsimonious explanation for the observed differences in ADLI . Differential connectivity of MCs and TCs with distinct GC subclasses has long been predicted based on the putative morphological subdivisions of GC apical dendritic morphologies ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al', ', 1983 ) and separation of MC and TC lateral dendrites in the deep and superficial EPL ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al . , 1984 ) , respectively . However , distributed M/TC-GC connectivity along exceedingly long M/TC lateral dendrites has , thus far , precluded a direct demonstration of differential connectivity of MCs and TCs with distinct GC subclasses', 'Here , we provide quantitative evidence that GCs indeed form two distinct morphological subclasses – sGCs and dGCs – rather than a continuum of morphologies . Moreover , our results provide – to our knowledge – the first functional evidence that MCs and TCs engage distinct lateral inhibitory circuits , likely via differential connectivity with dGCs and sGCs , respectively', 'Future experiments involving selective manipulation of MCs vs . TCs and dGCs vs . sGCs will ultimately be needed in order to directly demonstrate whether ( and the degree to which ) these lateral inhibitory circuits overlap . Our data describe local , circuit-level mechanisms that can account for several differences between MC and TC odor-evoked responses observed in vivo', 'Weaker lateral inhibitory currents may contribute to the finding that TCs are less frequently inhibited by odors ( Nagayama et al . , 2004 ) . Additionally , the finding that intermediate and high firing rates are unaffected by lateral inhibition in TCs may help explain why TCs show odor-evoked responses that are more highly correlated to OSN input ( Adam et al', ', 2014 ) and less dependent on concentration ( Fukunaga et al . , 2012; Igarashi et al . , 2012 ) . Additionally , TCs firing above the upper bound of the effective activity range of lateral inhibition are shielded , not only from lateral inhibition , but other sources of GC-mediated inhibition as well , such as inhibition triggered by cortical feedback ( Boyd et al . , 2012; Markopoulos et al', ', 2012 ) , Consequently , the circuit-level differences we describe may explain why MCs but not TCs are decorrelated by cortical feedback ( Otazu et al . , 2015 ) . These circuit-level differences between MCs and TCs likely affect olfactory discrimination ( Figure 6 )', 'ADLI , but not subtractive or divisive inhibition , allows TCs and MCs to best discriminate between odors at low and high concentrations , respectively . Yet how does this improvement in discrimination occur ? Prior work has shown that activity in M/TC populations becomes decorrelated over time ( Bathellier et al', ', 2008; Cury and Uchida , 2010 ) and that this decorrelation is driven by GCs ( Gschwend et al . , 2015 ) . Additionally , GC-mediated M/TC decorrelation improves odor discrimination ( Gschwend et al . , 2015 ) . Consequently , ADLI likely improves odor discrimination by driving decorrelation of M/TC firing in ranges that engage lateral inhibition ( Arevian et al . , 2008 )', 'M/TCs firing at rates outside the effective range of lateral inhibition may be encoding complementary olfactory information beyond odor identity . Performing these experiments in acute slices provides the best opportunity to explore the causes and consequences of differences in lateral inhibition between MCs and TCs', 'Given the novel features and mechanisms of ADLI , using a reduced and carefully controlled system in which a single glomerulus can be reliably activated is an important first step', 'Moreover , our in vitro\\xa0approach allowed us to apply pharmacological manipulations that were vital in identifying differences in GC excitability ( Figure 5 ) rather than differences in glomerular layer circuitry ( Figure 1l ) as the main mechanism supporting differences in MC vs .

Importantly , however , our findings that MCs receive stronger lateral inhibitory currents and are affected at different ranges of firing rates than TCs are unlikely to reflect slicing artifacts', 'Due to slicing , some MCs and TCs that project to the M72 glomerulus will be truncated , and cells that reside farther from the M72 glomerulus have a higher probability of being truncated . However , our findings do not depend on the cell’s distance from the M72 glomerulus ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1; Figure 3—figure supplement 1 )', 'Additionally , the lateral dendrites of MCs and TCs innervate distinct strata of the EPL and these differences could result in differences in the fraction of original connections left intact following slicing', 'However , the effect of ADLI on MCs that are observed here following activation of an entire glomerulus closely mirrors the effects that were observed when activating a single presynaptic MC in our previous work ( Arevian et al . , 2008 )', 'That is , only the probability of finding connections and the absolute magnitude of the effect are increased by activating all of the cells associated with a glomerulus ( compared to the prior study when only a single presynaptic cell was activated )', 'This suggests that the critical feature of the effect ( maximal lateral inhibition at intermediate firing rates ) is a property of single connections rather than one that depends on having a full repertoire of connections intact', 'Moreover , the close correspondence of our GC data to previous in vivo\\xa0recordings of odor-evoked GC activity ( Wellis and Scott , 1990 ) , as well as the equivalent spontaneous synaptic activity – a proxy for circuit intactness – observed between sGCs and dGCs suggests that slicing artifacts cannot explain the differences in excitatory input or intrinsic excitability observed between sGCs and dGCs', 'Our in vitro\\xa0approach additionally cannot address multiple important factors that are only present in the intact animal . For instance , respiration and centrifugal feedback likely modulate ADLI in vivo . Addressing the extent to which ADLI affects odor-evoked responses in MCs and TCs in vivo\\xa0is thus an important future direction', 'Finally , what are the benefits of parallel processing ? In other sensory systems , different pathways may arise from functional differences at the initial stages of stimulus detection , which are then maintained through selective feedforward connectivity . In the olfactory system there is no evidence that MCs and TCs are targeted by distinct subsets of OSNs', 'Rather , we show that differences in bulbar circuitry are sufficient to generate important differences in response properties . Here we show that MCs and TCs perform odor discriminations best at separate concentration ranges and that a combination of MCs and TCs discriminates similar odors better than either population alone', 'These results suggests that parallel processing may offer similar benefits in other sensory systems in which stimulus intensities can vary over many orders of magnitude . For instance , rods and cones in the retina function best at different ranges of light intensity', 'Other similarities between the olfactory and visual systems suggest that the mechanisms behind parallel processing may be shared across sensory systems . In the retina , feature selectivity in each ganglion cell type emerges due to its connectivity to specific bipolar and amacrine cell types ( Masland , 2012 )', 'Similarly , differences in odor-evoked responses in MCs and TCs emerge due to differences in connectivity to OSNs , external tufted cells ( Najac et al . , 2011; Gire et al . , 2012 ) and GCs . Therefore , in these systems , feature selectivity is not inherited but emerges via differential connectivity with distinct neuron types', 'Similarly , recombining the specific features encoded in individual channels allows new features to emerge . For instance , if populations of neurons in higher order sensory areas integrate inputs from parallel sensory channels , such as the anterior piriform cortex ( Nagayama et al . , 2010; Igarashi et al', ', 2012 ) , and perform simple computations , such as averaging , new features may emerge ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ) . More complex integration mechanisms may allow the calculation of other complex stimulus features using the different information encoded in multiple parallel sensory channels', 'All experiments were completed in compliance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Carnegie Mellon University ( IACUC # AS15-010 ) and University of Pittsburgh ( IACUC # 15116582 ) .

This issue is of particular interest when considering brain areas in which distinct outputs are generated from initially homogeneous sources , such as in the olfactory system', 'In the mammalian olfactory bulb , firing of olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs ) excites two classes of projection neurons – mitral cells and tufted cells ( MCs and TCs ) . While long viewed as essentially equivalent neuron classes , emerging evidence shows that MCs and TCs exhibit distinct activity in vivo ( Nagayama et al . , 2004; Fukunaga et al . , 2012; Igarashi et al . , 2012; Adam et al', ', 2014; Otazu et al . , 2015 ) , suggesting that MCs and TCs encode complementary aspects of olfactory information . For instance , TCs respond to lower odor concentrations than MCs ( Igarashi et al . , 2012; Kikuta et al . , 2013 ) , suggesting that TCs are involved in processing near-threshold stimuli', 'Consistent with this notion of parallel pathways , MCs and TCs project their axons to many non-overlapping regions ( Nagayama et al . , 2010; Igarashi et al . , 2012 ) .

Previously , we have shown that lateral inhibition most strongly affects MCs firing at intermediate rates because coincident input is required for the activation of GCs ( Arevian et al', ', 2008 ) . This activity-dependent regulation of the strength of lateral inhibition onto MCs decorrelates MC responses to similar input more effectively than subtractive or divisive forms of inhibition ( Arevian et al . , 2008 )', 'Lateral inhibition onto TCs is largely unexplored , but the marked differences in MC and TC odor-evoked activity suggest that lateral inhibition onto TCs may operate differently . Here , we show that optogenetic activation of a single , gene-targeted glomerulus elicits larger and more asynchronous lateral inhibitory currents in nearby MCs than in TCs', 'Moreover , this same photostimulation paradigm inhibits spiking differently in MCs and TCs . While MCs are affected by lateral inhibition at intermediate firing rates ( ~50\\u2009Hz ) , TCs are affected when firing at low firing rates ( <25Hz ) .

In contrast , small inhibitory currents remained after limiting GC-mediated inhibition in MCs and TCs with intact apical dendrites ( Figure 1i , l )', 'Removing cells with cut apical dendrites and redoing the analysis presented in Figure 1l similarly shows that GCs contribute similar proportions of lateral inhibition onto MCs and TCs', 'These observations indicate that glomerular layer circuits make small and uniform contributions to lateral inhibition in MCs and TCs and thus are not the primary source of differences in lateral inhibition between MCs and TCs .

Additionally , these effects of lateral inhibition on firing rate were present even in short timescales matching a single 4\\u2009Hz sniff ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 )', 'Collectively , our results demonstrate that lateral inhibition is functionally distinct in MCs and TCs . This difference in activity-dependent lateral inhibition ( ADLI ) may arise from differences in the lateral inhibitory circuits engaged by MCs and TCs', 'Our finding that inhibition is largely unaffected by apical dendrite truncation suggests that differences in ADLI between MCs and TCs most likely involves inhibitory circuitry within the external plexiform layer ( EPL )', 'Consistent with MCs and TCs engaging distinct lateral inhibitory circuits within the EPL , classical morphological studies suggest that GCs are subdivided into superficial GCs ( sGCs ) , which innervate the superficial EPL , and deep GCs ( dGCs ) , which innervate the deep EPL ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al . , 1983 )', 'This putative morphological subdivision of GCs suggests that sGCs inhibit TC lateral dendrites in the superficial EPL while dGCs inhibit MC lateral dendrites in the deep EPL ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al . , 1984 ) . Therefore , functional differences between sGCs and dGCs may mechanistically underlie the difference in ADLI observed between MCs and TCs', 'In particular , given our prior results demonstrating that low firing rates in MCs are unaffected by lateral inhibition because many GCs require cooperative inputs from multiple glomeruli in order to be activated ( Arevian et al', ', 2008 ) , we hypothesized that low firing rates in TCs are affected by lateral inhibition because sGCs are more strongly recruited than dGCs following activation of a single glomerulus . Several previous findings are consistent with this hypothesis . GC soma position correlates with GC subtype ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al', ', 1983 ) and odor-evoked activity in vivo ( Wellis and Scott , 1990 ) . Specifically , GCs located in the MCL and upper GCL tend to exhibit sGC morphologies and suprathreshold odor responses while GCs located in the lower GCL tend to exhibit dGC morphologies and subthreshold odor responses ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al . , 1983; Wellis and Scott , 1990 )', 'Whether these differences in odor-evoked activity in vivo\\xa0reflect functional differences between GC subtypes and M/TC connectivity remains unclear , however , as: 1 ) odors activate multiple glomeruli in distinct spatiotemporal patterns , which can evoke a complex array of convergent excitation and inhibition onto individual GCs ( Burton and Urban , 2015 ) , and 2 ) GC activity in vivo\\xa0is strongly influenced by centrifugal input ( Balu et al', ', 2007; Boyd et al . , 2012; Markopoulos et al . , 2012 ) and anesthesia ( Kato et al . , 2012; Cazakoff et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , to more directly test our above hypothesis , we recorded the excitatory synaptic input and spiking response of GCs to activation of single nearby glomeruli , with post-hoc recovery of Neurobiotin-filled cell morphologies', 'For this experiment , we switched from selective optogenetic stimulation of M72 glomeruli to extracellular stimulation of untagged glomeruli in order to test a large number of GC-glomerulus pairs', 'While this approach introduces a degree of glomerulus-to-glomerulus variability to our data , we capitalized on the well-established all-or-none nature of glomerular activation at low stimulation intensities ( Carlson et al . , 2000; Gire and Schoppa , 2009 ) to enable across-cell comparisons of synaptic input and spiking responses following glomerular activation', 'In addition , we and others have previously demonstrated that optogenetic photostimulation and extracellular stimulation of OSN axons trigger comparable sensory-evoked input to both M/TCs and GCs ( Gire et al . , 2012; Burton and Urban , 2014 , 2015 ) . Consistent with previous morphological accounts ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al', ', 1983 ) , GCs exhibited distinct sGC or dGC morphologies upon visual inspection ( Figure 4a , d; Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Indeed , reconstruction and visual classification of a large subset of recorded GCs and analysis of the spatial distribution of gemmules – the site of reciprocal dendrodendritic synapse formation ( Rall et al', ', 1966 ) – confirmed that sGCs preferentially innervate the superficial EPL while dGCs preferentially innervate the deep EPL ( Figure 4g ) . Moreover , somatic depth significantly – but incompletely – predicted GC subtype ( Figure 4a , d; Figure 4—figure supplement 1; Figure 4—source data 1 , Table 1 ) , as previously observed ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al . , 1983 )', 'To determine whether the observed morphological differences reflect subtypes of GCs rather than a continuum , we additionally performed unbiased clustering of GCs', 'Specifically , clustering of GCs by the Euclidean distances among their normalized gemmule distributions ( using Ward’s method ) and application of the gap statistic method yielded 3 distinct clusters: dGCs , sGCs , and a small group of sGCs with prominent innervation of the deep glomerular layer ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1c )', 'Moreover , these clusters closely aligned with our original classification by visual inspection , with 19 of 19 sGCs and 9 of 11 dGCs correctly assigned ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1c ) .

Critically , recordings of spontaneous synaptic activity were performed in the absence of TTX and thus contain some degree of action potential-dependent input , which likely originates from intact presynaptic cells', 'Therefore , equal spontaneous event frequencies between sGCs and dGCs suggests that their respective presynaptic circuits are comparably intact . Moreover , equal spontaneous event amplitudes suggest a comparable contribution of larger action potential-dependent and smaller action potential-independent events between sGCs and dGCs , again consistent with comparably intact presynaptic circuits', 'In total , our results thus support the hypothesis sGCs are more strongly recruited than dGCs following activation of a single glomerulus due to stronger excitatory input and greater intrinsic excitability , although we cannot rule out an important role for other mechanisms , especially in the intact system in vivo', 'As an additional test of our hypothesis that differences in the excitability of GCs provide one potential mechanism underlying the functional difference in ADLI between MCs and TCs , we measured the effects of lateral inhibition on MC spiking before and after increasing the excitability of GCs with the mGluR agonist ( RS ) -3 , 5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ( DHPG , 10 µM ) ( Dong et al', ', 2007; Heinbockel et al . , 2007 ) . At this concentration , DHPG selectively enhances the excitability of GCs ( Heinbockel et al . , 2004 ) but not MCs ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 )', 'The effective activity range of lateral inhibition in MCs ( n=6 ) fell from 31 ( ± 9 ) –73 ( ± 10 ) Hz to 16 ( ± 12 ) –49 ( ± 23 ) Hz after adding DHPG ( Figure 5a–d ) , and the lower and upper bounds of the effective activity range of lateral inhibition were significantly reduced after the addition of DHPG ( Figure 5e )', 'Additionally , these effects did not depend on whether apical dendrites were intact ( Figure 5d ) , and therefore does not reflect effects of DHPG on glomerular layer circuitry . Despite these observations , however , we note that increased GC excitability may not be the sole mechanism responsible for these DHPG-induced shifts in the effective range of lateral inhibition', 'For instance , DHPG-induced increases in the excitability of external tufted\\xa0cells ( Dong and Ennis , 2014 ) may , in turn , increase the activity in M72-MCs , the activity in GCs and GC-mediated inhibition onto the recorded MC', 'These data ( Figures 4–5 ) provide two indirect lines of evidence that suggest that differences in GC populations provide one mechanism for differences in the effective activity range of lateral inhibition onto MCs and TCs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 16039 . 015Figure 5 .

In this simulation , each MC or TC received excitatory input from one of the 150 glomeruli . On each trial , we randomly presented one odor from the panel to networks comprised entirely of either MCs or TCs', 'We applied a common decoding algorithm , linear discriminant analysis , to determine the extent to which different odors were discriminable in our simulated MC and TC populations ( Figure 6c )', 'While the strategy that downstream brain areas use to decode information contained in MC and TC outputs is unknown , linear discriminant analysis is a simple classification algorithm , has some degree of biological plausibility and has been widely applied in similar contexts ( Quiroga et al . , 2007; Quian Quiroga and Panzeri , 2009; Giridhar et al . , 2011 )', 'We first compared the discrimination accuracy of three models: one in which ADLI affected low rates ( i . e . an all TC network ) , one in which ADLI affected intermediate rates ( i . e . an all MC network ) , and a control population that lacked any inhibition', 'ADLI was modeled by explicitly adjusting the sensitivity of MC and TC firing rates to inhibition without changing other parameters of the model ( Figure 6d–e ) . When the odor panel consisted of only 8 odors , both MC and TC populations discriminated between odors with an accuracy that did not differ from the control population that lacked inhibition ( Figure 6f )', 'However , when we increased the difficulty of the task by increasing the size of the odor panel ( to 32 odors ) , the difference in accuracy between MCs and TCs dramatically increased ( Figure 6g )', 'For the set of 32 odors , TCs significantly outperformed MCs and the control population at low odor concentrations ( 90% accuracy in TCs compared to 70% accuracy in MCs at 30% of maximum concentration ) while MCs significantly outperformed TCs and the control population at high concentrations ( 73% accuracy in TCs compared to 91% accuracy in MCs at 60% of maximum concentration )', 'Therefore , differences in ADLI alone support concentration-dependent differences in odor discrimination . Next we tested how well different forms of activity-independent inhibition compare to ADLI in their ability to improve discrimination accuracy', 'Specifically , we compared discrimination accuracy ( in panels consisting of 32 odors ) between 3 populations of neurons; one with subtractive inhibition ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2a ) , one with divisive inhibition ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2b ) and a control population that lacked inhibition', 'We found that populations using subtractive or divisive inhibition performed no better than the control population across all concentrations ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2c )', 'These results agree with prior work that showed that ADLI substantially decorrelates MC responses to similar odors while subtractive and divisive forms of lateral inhibition have little effect on MC correlation ( Arevian et al . , 2008 )', 'Prior work has shown that , in addition to ADLI differences , TCs are more intrinsically excitable ( Burton and Urban , 2014 ) and receive stronger OSN inputs than MCs ( Gire et al . , 2012; Burton and Urban , 2014 ) . Therefore , we next asked how well these differences between MCs and TCs affect odor discrimination', 'Differences in the strength of OSN input and intrinsic excitability were modeled by altering sigmoid functions that relate the intensity of glomerular inputs to M/TC outputs ( Figure 6h ) . These differences in MC vs . TC excitability and OSN input strength also allow TCs and MCs to discriminate odors best at low and high concentrations respectively ( Figure 6i )', 'Finally we simulated how all three differences between MCs and TCs – ADLI , intrinsic excitability and glomerular input –\\xa0affected odor concentration . Intriguingly , TCs were best at discriminating between low concentration odors when all three differences were included in the model ( Figure 6j )', 'Together , these simulations show that intrinsic and circuit-level differences between MCs and TCs work cooperatively to optimize discrimination between similar odors in separate concentration ranges . Finally , we asked more generally how sensory systems , including the olfactory system , might benefit from splitting information into multiple channels with distinct ADLI', 'First , we asked whether models containing a combination of MCs and TCs discriminate odors better than models that have only MCs or TCs . We used a variant of the models presented above: here , each glomerulus provided input to 2 neurons instead of 1', 'We compared three different output neuron configurations: 2 MCs per glomerulus , 2 TCs per glomerulus , and 1 MC and 1 TC per glomerulus ( Figure 6k , see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods ) . Similar to the data presented in Figure 6g , TC models discriminated between 32 odors best at low concentrations and MC models were best at high concentrations ( Figure 6l )', 'However , MC-TC models significantly outperformed other models at intervening odor concentrations', 'Interestingly , MC-TC models also exhibited the second best performance at high and low concentrations , and after averaging discrimination accuracy across all concentrations tested , we found that models containing a combination of MCs and TCs performed significantly better than models composed of only MCs or only TCs ( Figure 6m )', 'Second , new features might arise in any brain area that implements ADLI and splits information into parallel channels . Using an image processing analogy , we show that if an image is split into parallel channels and then recombined by a downstream population , new information about the image ( i . e . higher contrast ) , absent in either single channel , emerges ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 )', 'Therefore systems that split sensory information into multiple pathways can not only outperform single pathway systems at comparable tasks , but are also capable of performing novel computations unlikely to occur in single pathway systems . \\n Parallel pathways are a common feature of many sensory systems', 'Yet how local\\xa0circuit activity creates stimulus selectivity in parallel pathways remains poorly understood . Here , we have identified a novel circuit mechanism for generating differential responses across two parallel pathways ( formed by MCs and TCs ) in the olfactory system and examined the emergence of feature selectivity', 'We find that differences in ADLI selectively reduce intermediate firing rates in MCs and low firing rates in TCs . We provide evidence that these effects could be caused , in part , by differences in the excitability of subclasses of GCs that preferentially inhibit TCs vs . MCs', 'Moreover , using simulations , we show that differences in the effective activity range of lateral inhibition , along with other intrinsic and circuit-level differences between MCs and TCs , work cooperatively to enable MCs and TCs to best discriminate between similar odors in separate concentration ranges', \"Finally , we show that the combination of MCs and TCs facilitates odor discrimination across a wide range of odor concentrations . The activity-dependence of lateral inhibition depends on three cell populations – the 'presynaptic'\\xa0M/TCs associated with the M72 glomerulus ( which we activate optogenetically via stimulation of OSNs ) , the inhibitory interneurons and the 'postsynaptic' M/TCs\", 'Our prior work has shown that increasing the firing rate of presynaptic MCs ( the M72 MCs in this case ) shifts the range of MC firing rates influenced by lateral inhibition ( Arevian et al . , 2008 )', 'Given that TCs fire at higher rates than MCs following glomerular activation ( Burton and Urban , 2014 ) , M72 TCs will fire at higher rates than M72 MCs following M72 photoactivation and , in part , contribute to the decreased lower bound of the effective activity range of lateral inhibition in postsynaptic TCs', 'However , higher firing rates in M72 TCs alone is insufficient to explain the differences in both the lower and upper bound in the effective activity range of lateral inhibition between MCs and TCs . Our analysis supports the hypothesis that TCs and MCs are preferentially connected to sGCs and dGCs , respectively', 'Additionally , we provide indirect evidence that differences in the recruitability of sGCs and dGCs may be one potential mechanism underlying the differences in ADLI between MCs and TCs . Our data suggests that sGCs spike with a higher probability than dGCs following the activation of a single glomerulus', 'Consequently , postsynaptic TCs can effectively recruit lateral inhibition when firing at low rates . dGCs are less excitable and therefore require more input to be activated . Therefore M72 photostimulation alone causes relatively weak activation of dGCs . However , when the postsynaptic MC fires at intermediate rates , additional dGCs will become activated and mediate lateral inhibition', 'In support of this mechanism , we show that increasing the excitability of GCs by activating mGluRs ( Dong et al . , 2007; Heinbockel et al . , 2007 ) shifts the effective activity range of lateral inhibition in MCs to lower firing rates ( Figure 5 )', 'Additionally , these differences between sGCs and dGCs can explain why the upper bound on the effective activity range of lateral inhibition differs between MCs and TCs . Cells firing above this upper bound recruit the maximum amount of recurrent inhibition such that additional inputs to GCs cannot trigger additional GABA release ( Urban and Arevian , 2009 )', 'Because sGCs are more excitable than dGCs , maximal GABA release , and consequently the upper bound on the effective activity range of lateral inhibition , occurs at lower rates in TCs than in MCs ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 )', 'While preferential connectivity of TCs with sGCs and MCs with dGCs can explain the observed differences in the activity-dependence of lateral inhibition , other circuit mechanisms may also contribute . In particular , EPL interneurons ( EPL-INs ) can mediate inhibition onto M/TCs ( Huang et al . , 2013; Kato et al . , 2013; Miyamichi et al', ', 2013 ) , and it remains possible that EPL-INs or distinct subclasses of EPL-INs preferentially inhibit MCs or TCs . However , it is unlikely that EPL-INs predominantly drive the difference in MC vs . TC ADLI given that EPL-INs mediate linear ( divisive ) but not activity-dependent inhibition of MC/TC outputs ( Kato et al . , 2013; Uchida et al . , 2013 )', 'Glomerular layer circuits have also been shown to play a role in M/TC lateral inhibition ( Aungst et al . , 2003; Liu et al . , 2013; Whitesell et al . , 2013; Banerjee et al . , 2015 ) , however these circuits likely do not play a role in the differences in ADLI reported here because our results were not influenced by apical dendrite truncation', 'Therefore , distinct GC populations that differ in excitability are the most parsimonious explanation for the observed differences in ADLI . Differential connectivity of MCs and TCs with distinct GC subclasses has long been predicted based on the putative morphological subdivisions of GC apical dendritic morphologies ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al', ', 1983 ) and separation of MC and TC lateral dendrites in the deep and superficial EPL ( Mori et al . , 1983; Orona et al . , 1984 ) , respectively . However , distributed M/TC-GC connectivity along exceedingly long M/TC lateral dendrites has , thus far , precluded a direct demonstration of differential connectivity of MCs and TCs with distinct GC subclasses', 'Here , we provide quantitative evidence that GCs indeed form two distinct morphological subclasses – sGCs and dGCs – rather than a continuum of morphologies . Moreover , our results provide – to our knowledge – the first functional evidence that MCs and TCs engage distinct lateral inhibitory circuits , likely via differential connectivity with dGCs and sGCs , respectively', 'Future experiments involving selective manipulation of MCs vs . TCs and dGCs vs . sGCs will ultimately be needed in order to directly demonstrate whether ( and the degree to which ) these lateral inhibitory circuits overlap . Our data describe local , circuit-level mechanisms that can account for several differences between MC and TC odor-evoked responses observed in vivo', 'Weaker lateral inhibitory currents may contribute to the finding that TCs are less frequently inhibited by odors ( Nagayama et al . , 2004 ) . Additionally , the finding that intermediate and high firing rates are unaffected by lateral inhibition in TCs may help explain why TCs show odor-evoked responses that are more highly correlated to OSN input ( Adam et al', ', 2014 ) and less dependent on concentration ( Fukunaga et al . , 2012; Igarashi et al . , 2012 ) . Additionally , TCs firing above the upper bound of the effective activity range of lateral inhibition are shielded , not only from lateral inhibition , but other sources of GC-mediated inhibition as well , such as inhibition triggered by cortical feedback ( Boyd et al . , 2012; Markopoulos et al', ', 2012 ) , Consequently , the circuit-level differences we describe may explain why MCs but not TCs are decorrelated by cortical feedback ( Otazu et al . , 2015 ) . These circuit-level differences between MCs and TCs likely affect olfactory discrimination ( Figure 6 )', 'ADLI , but not subtractive or divisive inhibition , allows TCs and MCs to best discriminate between odors at low and high concentrations , respectively . Yet how does this improvement in discrimination occur ? Prior work has shown that activity in M/TC populations becomes decorrelated over time ( Bathellier et al', ', 2008; Cury and Uchida , 2010 ) and that this decorrelation is driven by GCs ( Gschwend et al . , 2015 ) . Additionally , GC-mediated M/TC decorrelation improves odor discrimination ( Gschwend et al . , 2015 ) . Consequently , ADLI likely improves odor discrimination by driving decorrelation of M/TC firing in ranges that engage lateral inhibition ( Arevian et al . , 2008 )', 'M/TCs firing at rates outside the effective range of lateral inhibition may be encoding complementary olfactory information beyond odor identity . Performing these experiments in acute slices provides the best opportunity to explore the causes and consequences of differences in lateral inhibition between MCs and TCs', 'Given the novel features and mechanisms of ADLI , using a reduced and carefully controlled system in which a single glomerulus can be reliably activated is an important first step', 'Moreover , our in vitro\\xa0approach allowed us to apply pharmacological manipulations that were vital in identifying differences in GC excitability ( Figure 5 ) rather than differences in glomerular layer circuitry ( Figure 1l ) as the main mechanism supporting differences in MC vs . TC ADLI . We note , however , that our in vitro\\xa0approach also has certain limitations', 'In particular , the slicing procedure may introduce artifacts that could confound our conclusions . Importantly , however , our findings that MCs receive stronger lateral inhibitory currents and are affected at different ranges of firing rates than TCs are unlikely to reflect slicing artifacts', 'Due to slicing , some MCs and TCs that project to the M72 glomerulus will be truncated , and cells that reside farther from the M72 glomerulus have a higher probability of being truncated . However , our findings do not depend on the cell’s distance from the M72 glomerulus ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1; Figure 3—figure supplement 1 )', 'Additionally , the lateral dendrites of MCs and TCs innervate distinct strata of the EPL and these differences could result in differences in the fraction of original connections left intact following slicing', 'However , the effect of ADLI on MCs that are observed here following activation of an entire glomerulus closely mirrors the effects that were observed when activating a single presynaptic MC in our previous work ( Arevian et al . , 2008 )', 'That is , only the probability of finding connections and the absolute magnitude of the effect are increased by activating all of the cells associated with a glomerulus ( compared to the prior study when only a single presynaptic cell was activated )', 'This suggests that the critical feature of the effect ( maximal lateral inhibition at intermediate firing rates ) is a property of single connections rather than one that depends on having a full repertoire of connections intact', 'Moreover , the close correspondence of our GC data to previous in vivo\\xa0recordings of odor-evoked GC activity ( Wellis and Scott , 1990 ) , as well as the equivalent spontaneous synaptic activity – a proxy for circuit intactness – observed between sGCs and dGCs suggests that slicing artifacts cannot explain the differences in excitatory input or intrinsic excitability observed between sGCs and dGCs', 'Our in vitro\\xa0approach additionally cannot address multiple important factors that are only present in the intact animal . For instance , respiration and centrifugal feedback likely modulate ADLI in vivo . Addressing the extent to which ADLI affects odor-evoked responses in MCs and TCs in vivo\\xa0is thus an important future direction', 'Finally , what are the benefits of parallel processing ? In other sensory systems , different pathways may arise from functional differences at the initial stages of stimulus detection , which are then maintained through selective feedforward connectivity . In the olfactory system there is no evidence that MCs and TCs are targeted by distinct subsets of OSNs', 'Rather , we show that differences in bulbar circuitry are sufficient to generate important differences in response properties . Here we show that MCs and TCs perform odor discriminations best at separate concentration ranges and that a combination of MCs and TCs discriminates similar odors better than either population alone', 'These results suggests that parallel processing may offer similar benefits in other sensory systems in which stimulus intensities can vary over many orders of magnitude . For instance , rods and cones in the retina function best at different ranges of light intensity', 'Other similarities between the olfactory and visual systems suggest that the mechanisms behind parallel processing may be shared across sensory systems . In the retina , feature selectivity in each ganglion cell type emerges due to its connectivity to specific bipolar and amacrine cell types ( Masland , 2012 )', 'Similarly , differences in odor-evoked responses in MCs and TCs emerge due to differences in connectivity to OSNs , external tufted cells ( Najac et al . , 2011; Gire et al . , 2012 ) and GCs . Therefore , in these systems , feature selectivity is not inherited but emerges via differential connectivity with distinct neuron types', 'Similarly , recombining the specific features encoded in individual channels allows new features to emerge . For instance , if populations of neurons in higher order sensory areas integrate inputs from parallel sensory channels , such as the anterior piriform cortex ( Nagayama et al . , 2010; Igarashi et al', ', 2012 ) , and perform simple computations , such as averaging , new features may emerge ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ) . More complex integration mechanisms may allow the calculation of other complex stimulus features using the different information encoded in multiple parallel sensory channels', 'All experiments were completed in compliance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Carnegie Mellon University ( IACUC # AS15-010 ) and University of Pittsburgh ( IACUC # 15116582 ) .

We found that oscillating receptors respond to electric pulses by resetting their phase , resulting in transient synchrony among receptors that encodes signal timing and location , but not waveform', 'These receptors were most sensitive to frequencies found only in the collective signals of groups of conspecifics , and this was correlated with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies . Thus , different perceptual capabilities correspond to different receptor physiologies . We hypothesize that these divergent mechanisms represent adaptations for different social environments', 'Our findings provide the first evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony . \\n Evolutionary change in sensory systems can have profound effects on perception and behavior ( Carlson and Arnegard , 2011; Carlson , 2012; Baldwin et al . , 2014 ) . Recently , we documented a striking example of evolutionary change in the electrosensory systems of weakly electric fish ( Carlson et al', ', 2011 ) . Anatomical modifications of sensory receptors and the associated brain pathway that processes electric communication signals resulted in a newfound ability to detect subtle variations in these signals . This perceptual expansion led to a dramatic increase in the rates of signal evolution and species diversification', 'However , how these anatomical and perceptual differences relate to physiological differences in the underlying information processing mechanisms was unknown . Here , we investigate how evolutionary divergence in sensory perception relates to differences in peripheral sensory coding', 'Mormyrid fish communicate by producing a species-specific electric organ discharge ( EOD ) at variable interpulse intervals ( IPIs ) ( see Carlson , 2002 for review ) . The ability of some species to detect subtle variation in EOD waveforms is related to differences in the anatomy and physiology of peripheral sensory receptors called knollenorgans ( Harder , 1968a , 1968b; Carlson et al . , 2011 )', 'In species sensitive to waveform variation , these receptors are broadly distributed across the head , back , and underbelly ( Carlson et al . , 2011 ) .

Oscillations in neural activity are widespread throughout the brains of many animals , including humans , and are known to play important roles in generating rhythmic motor behaviors ( Ramirez et al . , 2004; McCrea and Rybak , 2008 )', 'However , how oscillations contribute to processes such as sleep , attention , memory , motor output , and sensory coding remains unclear ( Buzsaki and Draguhn , 2004; Thut et al . , 2012; Canavier , 2015 ) . Oscillations could facilitate multiplexed signal coding in which spikes carry information depending on the phase of the oscillation during which they occur ( Thut et al . , 2012 )', 'Another effect of oscillations could be to enhance communication between neural populations during periods of synchronized excitability ( Thut et al . , 2012 ) . Additional hypothesized functions include signal gating , feature binding , and cross-modal integration ( Thut et al', ', 2012 ) , although a clear functional role for electrical oscillations in sensory processing has remained elusive ( Canavier , 2015 ) .

This is the first demonstration of information coding by oscillatory synchrony at the periphery', 'These phase resets did not encode pulse waveform , explaining why species with oscillating receptors cannot behaviorally discriminate EOD waveform variation', 'Furthermore , we provide physiological and behavioral evidence that oscillating receptors respond most strongly to communication signals with fast temporal patterns that are only produced by large groups of conspecifics , suggesting that oscillating receptors may be specialized for group signal detection', 'To measure baseline activity rates , we recorded extracellular spontaneous activity from the sensory receptors of five species ( Figure 1 ) .

Decreases in EOD rate , or social silence , have been hypothesized to allow the silent fish to attend to another fish's signals or to make the silent fish electrically ‘invisible’ to other fish ( Moller et al . , 1989 )\", 'As previously described in another species ( Post and von der Emde , 1999 ) , the same fish often produced both an increase and a decrease in response to a stimulus ( Figure 9 ) . In general , P . tenuicauda tended to respond with a decrease followed by an increase ( Figure 9A ) , whereas P . microphthalmus tended to respond with an increase followed by a decrease ( Figure 9B )', \"Regardless of an individual's response pattern , we measured the maximum increase and decrease in EOD rate in response to each stimulus and compared the fish's electric signaling activity evoked by IPI stimuli to that evoked by a single conspecific EOD . A species with oscillating receptors produced the strongest EOD rate increases at the shortest and longest IPIs tested ( P\", 'tenuicauda in Figure 9C ) . The shortest IPIs ( ≤5 ms ) correspond to those found only in signals recorded from groups of fish . A congeneric species with spiking receptors ( P . microphthalmus in Figure 9D ) responded differently to IPIs than the species with oscillating receptors ( repeated-measures ANOVA , interaction between species and IPI , F ( 6 , 12 ) = 3 . 4 , p = 0 . 0048 )', 'The species with spiking receptors produced the greatest EOD rate increases for IPIs in the intermediate range of those tested , which roughly correspond to the minimum IPI produced by individual fish .

Accordingly , there was a significant effect of species in a repeated-measures ANOVA ( F ( 1 ) = 18 , p = 0 . 0012 ) , but no interaction effect between species and IPI ( F ( 6 , 12 ) = 1 . 0 , p = 0 . 43 )', 'The potential social implications of variation in the strength of EOD rate increases and decreases across this range of IPIs are unknown . These results lend support to our hypothesis that the frequency tuning of oscillating receptors may mediate detection of submillisecond IPIs that are only present in the communication signals produced by a large group of individuals', 'These very short IPIs elicit stronger responses in oscillating receptors and greater EOD rate increases in species with oscillatory receptors . Since spiking receptors cannot encode these submillisecond IPIs , we propose that oscillations are an adapation for detecting large groups of conspecifics', 'Here , we describe a novel mechanism for peripheral sensory coding in which sensory receptors with spontaneous oscillatory activity respond to stimuli with phase resets that result in transient synchrony across the population', 'The degree of synchrony provides information about pulse timing and polarity , but it does not reflect the precise timing cues within the pulse waveform , consistent with the inability of these fish to behaviorally detect EOD waveform variation ( Carlson et al . , 2011 ) . Further , oscillating receptors are most sensitive to submillisecond IPIs that match their oscillation period ( 0 . 47–0', '99 ms ) . This sensitivity is remarkable for two reasons . First , these submillisecond IPIs are too short for spiking receptors to reliably encode . Second , these IPIs are much shorter than those produced by individual fish , suggesting increased sensitivity to communication signals produced by groups of individuals', 'Indeed , playback experiments demonstrated that a species with oscillating receptors responded strongly to submillisecond IPIs within the range of enhanced receptor sensitivity . Thus , this novel peripheral coding mechanism may represent an adaptation for detecting communication signals from large groups of fish', 'Oscillatory electrical activity is widespread in neural networks ( Buzsaki and Draguhn , 2004 ) . Many studies have linked phase resets in ongoing cortical oscillations to perceptual performance , suggesting an important role for phase resets in sensory processing ( Thorne and Debener , 2014 )', 'However , whether these phase resets encode specific information about a sensory stimulus or instead serve a modulatory function remains to be determined ( Lakatos et al . , 2009 )', 'Futhermore , all phase resets previously described occur in central circuits and involve oscillations of much lower frequencies ( <100 Hz ) than those ( 1–3 kHz ) in the sensory receptors we describe ( Harder , 1968b; Thut et al . , 2012; Canavier , 2015 )', 'Using in vivo extracellular recordings from single receptors , we demonstrate that phase resets in the periphery lead to transient synchrony among receptors , enabling detection of and entrainment to very fast temporal patterns in communication signals . Sensitivity to temporal patterns has been shown to involve network interactions in a wide range of central circuits ( Klug et al', ', 2012; Buonomano , 2014 ) . Here , we show that electrical oscillations in sensory receptors can act as peripheral filters for temporal patterns . Spiking receptors are most sensitive to stimulus frequencies near those in conspecific EODs ( Hopkins , 1981; Bass and Hopkins , 1984; Lyons-Warren et al . , 2012 )', 'Peripheral sensory receptors whose maximal sensitivity corresponds to a principal feature present in the signal they detect are considered ‘matched filters’ ( Wehner , 1987 ) . Spiking receptors thus appear to be matched filters for conspecific EODs . Moreover , the precisely timed spikes in these receptors enable discrimination of waveform variation ( Hopkins and Bass , 1981; Carlson et al', ', 2011 ) , which would facilitate signaler identification . In fact , studies on species with spiking receptors have revealed behavioral sensitivity to individual differences in conspecific EODs ( Graff and Kramer , 1992; Hanika and Kramer , 2005 )', 'Collectively , these results support the hypothesis that spiking receptors are specialized for detecting communication signals produced by individual fish and encoding the information necessary to identify the sender . In contrast , oscillating receptors exhibit matched filters not for EOD waveforms , but for IPI patterns in group signals', \"A receptor's oscillation frequency is predictive of its frequency tuning . However , oscillating receptors are tuned to much lower frequencies than the peak power frequencies of conspecific EODs . Furthermore , these oscillation frequencies confer enhanced sensitivity to IPIs that can only be produced by groups of fish\", 'Therefore , whereas spiking receptors are specialized for detecting signals from individuals , oscillating receptors appear specialized for detecting signals from a large group . Importantly , the submillisecond IPIs to which oscillating receptors are most sensitive do not necessarily reflect concerted signaling amongst the group', 'It will be interesting to determine whether fish modulate their IPI patterns in groups and how this might affect the IPI distribution of collective signals . Differences in receptor physiology and tuning may relate to differences in social behavior', 'Species in the lineage with oscillatory receptors have been reported to school as adults and prefer open water ( Nichols and Griscom , 1917; Hopkins , 1980 , 1981; Chapman et al . , 1996; Lavoue et al', ', 2004; Lavoue , 2012 ) , unlike other species , which have generally been described as solitary and territorial , and prefer areas with dense vegetation and detritus ( Nichols and Griscom , 1917; Hopkins , 1980 , 1981; Hopkins and Bass , 1981; Chapman et al . , 1996; Friedman and Hopkins , 1996; Lavoue , 2012 )', 'In single-species lab tanks , Petrocephalus tenuicauda and Petrocephalus soudanensis form open-water shoals and schools , respectively , while Brevimyrus niger , Pollimyrus adspersus , and Brienomyrus brachyistius are solitary and seek shelter ( unpub . obs . )', \"Thus , the increased sensitivity of peripheral receptors for communication signals produced by groups of conspecifics may mediate the detection and localization of shoals or schools in fish's native habitats . However , P . microphthalmus presents an important exception\", 'These fish , with spiking receptors and associated sensitivity to EOD waveform variation , form schools both in laboratory and natural settings ( Lavoue et al . , 2004 ) . Field studies will be necessary to more fully understand how behavioral and ecological differences between species may have selected for different peripheral coding strategies and the perceptual abilities they confer', 'Previous work has demonstrated that electrical oscillations serve as a frequency-tuning mechanism in electroreceptors and non-mammalian hair cells ( Bennett , 1965 , 1967; Hopkins , 1976; Viancour , 1979; Watson and Bastian , 1979; Fettiplace and Fuchs , 1999; Kawasaki , 2001 , 2005 )', 'Indeed , damped oscillations in spike probability following an electrical stimulus in mormyrid spiking receptors may reflect subthreshold oscillations related to frequency tuning ( Bennett , 1965 , 1967; Roth and Szabo , 1972 ) . Spontaneous , noisy oscillations in paddlefish ampullary electroreceptors are hypothesized to contribute to prey detection ( Neiman and Russell , 2001 , 2011 )', 'In frog saccular hair cells , differences in spontaneous spiking vs oscillatory electrical activity are linked to differences in the density of three types of potassium channels ( Rutherford and Roberts , 2009 ) . Whether similar mechanisms contribute to high-frequency oscillations in some mormyrid species and spikes in other species remains to be determined', 'Furthermore , whether the oscillations that can be recorded extracellularly from rosette receptors represent collective spiking activity or non-spiking oscillatory potentials in sensory cells at the base of the receptor pore is also unknown', 'Importantly , the oscillations in mormyrid rosette receptors are distinct from oscillations in hair cells and other electroreceptors due to their larger amplitudes and higher frequencies , as well as the fact that they respond to stimuli with phase resets . To our knowledge , the phase resets reported here are the first observed in any oscillating sensory receptor', 'These stimulus-evoked phase resets result in transient synchrony across oscillating receptors . Since receptors have different intrinsic oscillation frequencies , this synchrony will rapidly decrease . Therefore , pooling the responses of multiple receptors could mediate synchrony detection and allow for the disambiguation of stimulus-evoked and spontaneous oscillations', 'Whether and where such integration may occur remains to be determined . A single afferent fiber could contact multiple receptors , or multiple afferents may converge onto single postsynaptic neurons in the hindbrain nucleus of the electrosensory lateral line lobe , as reported previously in a species with spiking receptors ( Bell and Grant , 1989 )', \"The entirety of our knowledge of electric communication signal coding in mormyrids had been limited to species with broadly distributed receptors ( see Baker et al . , 2013 for review ) , which fire spikes in all species that have been studied . These species' behavioral sensitivity to EOD waveform variation is due in part to the precise encoding of waveform timing cues by spiking receptors\", 'Spike-timing differences between receptors on opposite sides of the body are compared in the midbrain anterior exterolateral nucleus ( ELa ) , where excitation and inhibition from different receptive fields establish single-neuron selectivity for stimulus pulse durations ( Friedman and Hopkins , 1998; Lyons-Warren et al . , 2013 )', 'These duration-selective neurons project to the posterior exterolateral nucleus ( ELp ) , where single-neuron selectivity for IPIs arises ( Carlson , 2009 ) . Notably , species with rosette receptors have a smaller exterolateral nucleus ( EL ) that is not subdivided into anterior and posterior regions ( Carlson et al . , 2011 )', 'In all three species that have been studied , rosette receptors produce high-frequency oscillations ( this study , Harder , 1968b ) . How electric communication signals are processed centrally in the EL of these species remains unknown', 'Central processing of oscillatory receptor inputs could contribute to distinguishing self-generated stimuli from external stimuli while maximizing sensitivity to external stimuli . In the absence of an electric stimulus , the spontaneous oscillations across receptors are asynchronized', 'When the fish emits its own EOD , receptors in all rosettes will experience stimuli of identical polarity based on the direction of current flow through the receptors ( Hopkins , 1986 ) . This means that oscillations in all receptors will reset to the same phase in synchrony', \"In this case , subtracting the oscillatory responses of receptors on opposite sides of the body would result in cancellation . In contrast , in the presence of an external electric stimulus , receptors at different locations on the fish's body will experience opposite-polarity stimuli and will reset to opposite phases\", 'Subtraction of these opposite-phase responses would increase oscillation amplitudes relative to single-receptor oscillations , thus potentially increasing sensitivity to external signals . The electrosensory system could implement a subtraction mechanism if oscillatory receptors on one side of the body mediate excitation , and receptors on the opposite side mediate inhibition onto central neurons', 'In response to self-generated signals , excitation would arrive coincidentally with inhibition , thus canceling responses . This proposed mechanism would also provide the information necessary to locate external signal sources', 'Stimuli coming from one direction would elicit maximal excitation from one side of the body and minimal inhibition from the other side , whereas stimuli from the opposite direction would elicit minimal excitation and maximal inhibition . The directionality would presumably be reversed in the contralateral hemisphere , leading to a reversed directional preference', 'Given the excitatory–inhibitory interactions found in the ELa of species with broadly distributed receptors ( Friedman and Hopkins , 1998; Lyons-Warren et al . , 2013 ) , similar interactions could occur in a homologous circuit within the midbrain EL . The mormyrid family contains two subfamilies called Mormyrinae and Petrocephalinae ( Sullivan et al . , 2000 )', 'Most mormyrine species have broadly distributed receptors , ELa/ELp , and behavioral sensitivity to EOD waveform variation ( Carlson et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , most petrocephaline species have receptors organized into rosettes as well as an EL midbrain region , and they are not sensitive to EOD waveform variation ( Carlson et al . , 2011 ) . One interesting exception is P', 'microphthalmus , which has broadly distributed receptors and ELa/ELp , and it can also detect EOD waveform variation ( Carlson et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , P . microphthalmus represents a striking case of parallel evolution in which a perceptual ability arose twice independently , once in Mormyrinae and once in P . microphthalmus ( Carlson et al . , 2011 )', 'Here , we show that the broadly distributed receptors of P . microphthalmus fire spikes and display similar physiological properties to the spiking receptors of all mormyrine species studied ( this study , Bennett , 1965; Harder , 1968b; Hopkins , 1981; Arnegard et al . , 2006 ) .

To determine whether the oscillatory activity of different receptors was correlated , we obtained the instantaneous phase of oscillations of two receptors recorded simultaneously using a Hilbert transform in Matlab', 'We then computed the circular correlation coefficient between the phases of two simultaneous recordings ( Berens , 2009 ) . For each pair of receptors , we generated two surrogate data sets of non-simultaneous recordings . The first data set consisted of the first 1-s recording from one receptor and the fifth 1-s recording from the other receptor', 'The second data set consisted of the fifth 1-s recording from one receptor and the first 1-s recording from the other receptor . We measured frequency tuning in spiking receptors following previously described methods ( Lyons-Warren et al . , 2012 ) .

The frequency with the lowest threshold was defined as the receptor's best frequency . We generated normalized tuning curves by setting threshold intensities as dB relative to the threshold intensity at the best frequency\", 'For oscillating receptors , we generated tuning curves by plotting vector strength vs stimulus frequency . We defined the best frequency as the frequency with the highest vector strength . In three of eight oscillating receptors , the best frequencies in response to positive- and negative-polarity stimuli differed slightly', \"In these cases , we determined the receptor's best frequency by averaging the best frequencies to each stimulus polarity . To study how spiking receptors encode electric pulse waveform , we averaged the time of the first spike that occurred after stimulus onset ( positive-polarity stimuli ) or stimulus offset ( negative-polarity stimuli )\", 'The difference in average spike times elicited by stimuli of opposite polarities was defined as the spike-timing difference . Since receptors on opposite sides of the body experience stimuli of opposite polarities , this procedure is equivalent to measuring the difference in spike times between receptors at different locations on the body evoked by the same stimulus ( Hopkins , 1981 )', 'For a comparable measurement in oscillatory responses , we subtracted the average time of the first peak that occurred after the offset of the negative-polarity pulse from the average time of the first peak that occurred after the onset of the positive-polarity pulse for pulse durations longer than 0 . 5 ms . For shorter stimulus durations ( ≤0', '5 ms ) , we measured the difference in the times of the first oscillatory peaks that occurred after stimulus offset for each stimulus polarity . This procedure is equivalent to measuring the difference in oscillatory peak times between receptors on opposite sides of the body evoked by the same stimulus', 'To quantify the degree of oscillation amplitude enhancement , we first measured all prestimulus oscillation amplitudes on each recording trace , and then averaged across all repetitions of the same stimulus . Next , we measured the poststimulus oscillation amplitude on each recording trace and averaged across all repetitions of the same stimulus', \"Lastly , we divided the mean poststimulus oscillation amplitude by the mean prestimulus oscillation amplitude for each pulse duration . Since the peak power frequency of a single-cycle bipolar sine wave is slightly lower than the inverse of the wave's duration , we used Welch's power spectral density in Matlab to compute the power spectrum of each single-cycle sine wave\", 'We took the peak of the power spectrum as the frequency of each stimulus . We measured the difference in the phases of oscillatory resets evoked by opposite-polarity stimuli by first averaging the recorded potential across stimulus repetitions , and then measuring the first poststimulus period and the latency of the first poststimulus peak', 'We used these values to calculate the difference in the phase ( Δφ ) of oscillatory reset between responses to opposite-polarity pulses according toΔφ=latN−latP ( pN+pP2 ) ×360° , where latN is the latency of the first peak , and pN is the first period , respectively , evoked by the negative-polarity stimulus , and latP is the latency of the first peak , and pP is the first period , respectively , evoked by the positive-polarity stimulus', 'To measure spiking responses to paired pulses , we measured the interspike intervals between the spikes elicited by the onset ( positive-polarity stimuli ) or offset ( negative-polarity stimuli ) of each pulse . If no spikes occurred in response to the second pulse , no interspike intervals were recorded', 'For clarity , stimulus artifacts were removed from the recording traces shown in Figure 5A , B by drawing a straight line from the times of stimulus onset or offset plus 0 . 03 ms . In oscillating receptors , the stimulus artfact at the shortest IPIs tested obscured responses to the first pulse in the pair', 'To circumvent this issue , we first averaged oscillatory responses across stimulus presentations . Next , we measured the time interval between the first oscillatory peak that followed a single pulse and the first oscillatory peak that followed the second pulse in the pair . This method is equivalent to measuring the time interval between the first peaks following each pulse in the pair', 'We also measured the vector strength and poststimulus oscillation amplitude following the second pulse in the pair .

Next , we measured the fish's baseline response by averaging the resulting EOD rate over a window starting 0\", '2 s after the start of the 5-s prestimulus period and ending 0 . 2 s before stimulus onset .

      "\t ['Motor sequences are formed through the serial execution of different movements , but how nervous systems implement this process remains largely unknown . We determined the organizational principles governing how dirty fruit flies groom their bodies with sequential movements . Using genetically targeted activation of neural subsets , we drove distinct motor programs that clean individual body parts', 'This enabled competition experiments revealing that the motor programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy; motor programs that occur first suppress those that occur later . Cleaning one body part reduces the sensory drive to its motor program , which relieves suppression of the next movement , allowing the grooming sequence to progress down the hierarchy', 'A model featuring independently evoked cleaning movements activated in parallel , but selected serially through hierarchical suppression , was successful in reproducing the grooming sequence . This provides the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevailing model for generating human action sequences', 'Animals engage in a variety of complex serial behaviors that are essential for survival , such as nest building , communication , courtship , and prey capture . Serial behaviors can be subdivided into distinct motor actions that are mutually exclusive and often proceed in a given sequence ( Gallistel , 1980; Adams , 1984 )', 'While our understanding of how motor actions are produced expands ( Marder et al . , 2005; Bizzi and Cheung , 2008; Grillner and Jessell , 2009; Costa , 2011 ) , less is known about the rules that govern how nervous systems assemble individual actions into coordinated sequential behaviors', 'There are two main hypotheses about mechanisms that drive the sequential progression of actions during serial behavior . One hypothesis suggests that each action in a series triggers performance of the next action ( James , 1890; Adams , 1984 ) . This is one of the earliest views of motor sequencing and is thought to underlie some sequential behaviors , such as bird song ( Long et al . , 2010 )', 'An alternative hypothesis proposes that the premotor units of all actions in a sequence are activated or readied in parallel and then sequentially selected through winner-take-all competition ( Lashley , 1951; Houghton and Hartley , 1995; Bullock , 2004 )', 'This model was originally proposed based on human psychology experiments demonstrating a parallel representation of letter typing acts prior to the typing of a word . Electrophysiological evidence in primates is consistent with this parallel model of serial behavior ( Averbeck et al . , 2002; Mushiake et al . , 2006 )', 'However , it has been difficult to causatively confirm the model and determine its underlying action selection mechanisms . One strategy for testing how serial behavior is executed is to first identify the individual motor actions that make up the behavior and to then use neural control over each action to investigate how its manipulation affects the progression of the other actions in the series', 'Independent control of each action in a sequence is challenging to achieve in most systems . However , recent tool development in Drosophila melanogaster permits subdivisions of behavior to be identified and manipulated in freely moving flies by expressing neural activators in subsets of neurons in the brain', 'This approach has revealed that acute neural activation can trigger specific behaviors and subcomponents of behaviors , such as abdominal bending and courtship song ( two subcomponents of the courtship sequence ) ( Clyne and Miesenböck , 2008; von Philipsborn et al . , 2011; Flood et al . , 2013 )', 'While these tools have invigorated interest in identifying the neurons that drive behavior , they also enable experiments to probe the organization of serial behavior through specific control of individual motor actions', 'Here , we study the organizational principles underlying the neural control of serial action selection in an innate behavior common to most limbed animals—grooming ( Sachs , 1988 )', 'Grooming consists of discrete cleaning movements that occur in predictable sequences; however , the mechanisms that govern transitions between the movements are not known ( Szebenyi , 1969; Fentress and Stilwell , 1973; Dawkins and Dawkins , 1976; Sachs , 1988 )', 'Local mechanical stimulation of a body part causes fruit flies to perform precisely targeted cleaning sweeps with their front or hind legs towards that body part ( Vandervorst and Ghysen , 1980; Corfas and Dudai , 1989 )', 'In contrast , when they are completely coated in dust , flies coordinate a repertoire of cleaning movements to groom their whole bodies ( Figure 1A; Bentley , 1975; Phillis et al . , 1993 ) . We reasoned that we could exploit the behavior of such dust-coated flies to determine how different grooming actions are prioritized and ordered when they are stimulated at the same time', 'We show that dust on the body elicits different independently evoked cleaning motor programs for five body parts that progress in series . By genetically targeting different neural subsets , we gain experimental control over each cleaning motor program to demonstrate that they are organized into a suppression hierarchy', 'We next generate an empirically derived computational model that demonstrates how a suppression hierarchy can mediate the sequential selection of the cleaning motor programs .

This was achieved by coating flies in dust , paired with measurements of changing dust distributions on the body surface ( Figure 1B , C , Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2 ) and manual annotation of their cleaning movements ( Figure 1E; Video 1 )', 'In response to dust on their bodies , flies groomed with a predictable progression of targeted cleaning movements ( Figure 1D–F , Figure 1—figure supplement 3 , Figure 1—figure supplement 4B , C ) . This progression required dust , as undusted flies did not groom in a sequential progression ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4A , C )', 'Dusted flies rapidly cleaned their eyes and then focused on the antennae , demonstrating that they sequentially clean specific regions on the head ( Figure 1D ) . They next cleaned their posterior body parts in the order from abdomen to wings to thorax', 'The grooming progression occurred as a sequence in which the probabilities of cleaning different regions of the body gradually changed through time', 'That is , the progression was not absolutely unidirectional as flies returned to cleaning earlier body parts even though they had already started cleaning later body parts ( referred to as return cleaning ) ( Figure 1E , Figure 1—figure supplement 4B , example ethograms )', 'As the flies progressed through the grooming sequence , each bout of body part cleaning featured cyclic transitions between sweeps of the targeted region and rubbing of the legs against each other ( Figure 1G , Figure 1—figure supplement 5; Video 1 )', 'These cyclic bouts of leg rubbing likely occurred when the legs accumulated sufficient dust from sweeping the body , which was then rubbed towards the distal leg parts and removed . Grooming of the entire body did not necessarily proceed as a continuous process . Flies often paused to walk around and then resumed cleaning where they left off or transitioned to other body parts ( Figure 1G )', 'Thus , flies groom by gradually cleaning different body parts in bouts that are characterized by cyclic transitions between body cleaning sweeps and leg rubbing ( shown as a series of transition diagrams in Figure 1—figure supplement 6 ) .

We expressed the temperature-sensitive cation channel dTrpA1 ( UAS-dTrpA1 ) ( Hamada et al . , 2008 ) in different enhancer-driven GAL4 expression patterns in the nervous system ( Jenett et al . , 2012 ) and screened for grooming phenotypes ( see ‘Materials and methods’ for details )', 'Using this method to activate neurons targeted by different GAL4 lines , we discovered that grooming movements could indeed be independently activated in the absence of dust', 'We identified different GAL4 lines that caused exclusive cleaning of each body part , including the head , abdomen , wings , and legs ( Figure 2 , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 , Figure 2—figure supplement 2; see Video 2 , Video 3 , Video 4 , Video 5 , Video 6 , Video 7 , Video 8 , and Video 9 for representative videos and more detail regarding the behavioral phenotypes )', 'Some lines we identified drove cleaning of different body subparts such as the antennae , in agreement with our observations that flies precisely target cleaning of different regions of the head ( Figure 2 , R26B12 )', 'Although these lines were sufficient for driving highly specific cleaning movements , we did not find evidence that blocking the activity of their targeted neurons could disrupt dust-induced grooming ( tested using the neural inhibitors UAS-Shibirets1 or UAS-TNT , data not shown )', 'This suggests that the targeted neurons are sufficient but not necessary for driving their respective cleaning movements . All lines tested could activate continuous cleaning of their corresponding body parts for long periods of time ( at least 25 min )', 'Thus , grooming can be decomposed into specific motor programs ( hereafter referred to as cleaning modules ) that can be independently activated by subsets of neurons . Experimental induction of these cleaning modules via GAL4-expressed dTrpA1 allowed us to directly test how they are sequentially executed during the progression of grooming . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 011Figure 2', 'Activation of UAS-dTrpA1 in different GAL4 lines is sufficient to activate discrete cleaning movements in the absence of dust .

The fact that head cleaning suppresses other movements through both artificial and endogenous activation argues against the possibility that suppression was an artifact of dTrpA1 activation', 'These results support our hypothesis that the cleaning modules are competing for output via an intermodular suppression that favors those that are hierarchically superior . The full suppression hierarchy of cleaning modules is: eyes > antennae > abdomen > wings > thorax , which mirrors the serial order of grooming observed in dusted flies', 'Although the priority order of cleaning module execution can be attributed to a suppression hierarchy , the sequential progression of grooming requires the termination of the hierarchically superior cleaning module followed by selection of the next module', 'One possible explanation for the observed progression is that each module sequentially triggers the next module in the series , analogous to an activation chain ( James , 1890; Adams , 1984 ) . We tested this possibility using the GAL4 lines to elicit different cleaning modules in the absence of dust to see if activation of one cleaning module would stimulate execution of the next module', 'We found that activation and subsequent acute deactivation of neurons that controlled a given cleaning module did not directly elicit the next module in the grooming sequence ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3A , C ) . This indicated that an activation chain among the cleaning modules is not sufficient to direct the progression of grooming', 'This conclusion is supported by observations that cleaning movements are only directed to the body part that is stimulated and not to other parts ( Vandervorst and Ghysen , 1980; Corfas and Dudai , 1989; Kays et al', ', 2014 ) An alternative way by which grooming could progress is through a combination of the acute sensory cues provided by dust and the intrinsic suppression hierarchy among the cleaning modules . To test this hypothesis , we took advantage of the fact that artificial activation of specific cleaning modules blocks grooming of subordinate body parts ( Figure 3B )', 'Thus , if the cleaning modules are evoked by dust on specific body parts , then flies released from artificial activation should initiate cleaning of the next dirty body part in the hierarchy . We tested this prediction by rapidly cooling the dusted GAL4/UAS-dTrpA1 flies shown in Figure 3B to a temperature at which dTrpA1 is inactive , and then observing the first cleaning movements performed', 'In effect , flies were returned to a normal behavioral state but with different distributions of dust on their bodies ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3A , C ) . Indeed , flies resumed cleaning the body part downstream of where the sequence had been blocked ( Figure 3C , Figure 3—figure supplement 3B , D )', 'For example , flies with clean heads and abdomens , but dirty wings and thoraces , focused on cleaning their wings ( Figure 3C , line R24B03 ) . Thus , cleaning progresses to the next dirty and hierarchically superior part . We found that hierarchical suppression can mediate the selection of one among many simultaneously stimulated cleaning modules that are in competition for output', 'Between the proposed models describing how nervous systems execute serial actions , hierarchical suppression through competition is a core feature of parallel response models rather than activation chain models ( Houghton and Hartley , 1995; Bullock , 2004 )', 'The general schema for this motor-control strategy for grooming is shown in Figure 4A and consists of three layers: a sensory layer , a hierarchical layer , and a winner-take-all layer . The sensory layer consists of parallel sensory inputs that each independently activate a specific cleaning module', 'The hierarchical layer establishes differences in the activation levels between the cleaning modules ( described in detail below ) . The winner-take-all layer then selects the module with the highest activation level by suppressing execution of the other modules', 'Once a module is selected , the reduced sensory drive that results from cleaning dust from the relevant body part gradually lowers its activation level , thereby allowing cleaning to proceed to whichever module has the next highest activation level ( In Figure 4A , the removal of dust by a module is represented with blunt arrows from the winner-take-all layer to the dust )', 'Grooming proceeds from the module with the highest activation level to that with the lowest until dust is removed from all of the body parts .

We simulated both possible implementations with a computational model to test if they were sufficient to explain the progression of grooming that we observed . The winner-take-all layer is the same for both implementations', 'Winner-take-all neural networks can be modeled using all-to-all inhibitory connections between the different units; however , conceptually , they simply select the most active unit and inhibit the rest ( Houghton and Hartley , 1995 ) . In the model presented here , we selected the cleaning module with the highest activation level by using a maximum function ( ‘Materials and Methods’ )', 'The only difference between the two implementations of the model is how the activation level of each cleaning module is set in the hierarchical layer . If no differences are set in the relative activation levels between modules , the result is unordered grooming , with equal probability of the modules occurring ( Figure 4B )', 'Alternatively , the sensitivity to dust ( sensory gain ) across the modules can be varied , such that their activation levels are proportional to the amount of dust on each body part , weighted by their sensitivity to the dust stimulus ( gain of response to the dust stimulus )', 'With this schema , modules with the highest sensory gain had a higher probability of being selected than those with lower gains , reproducing the observed sequence of grooming behavior ( Figure 4C ) . We see a similar result when the differences in the activation levels of the competing modules arise from unidirectional ( asymmetric ) lateral inhibitory connections ( Figure 4D )', 'Thus , both simulations produce the sequential selection of cleaning modules observed in grooming behavior . This demonstrates that hierarchical suppression can be established through either variable sensory gain or direct unidirectional inhibition , in conjunction with winner-take-all selection of the module with the highest activation level', 'The model of hierarchical suppression also replicates the returns to previous cleaning modules that we observed with dusted flies ( Figure 1E ) . Based on the computational model , this occurs when the cleaning modules have relatively similar activation levels . For example , when no hierarchical differences are set among the modules ( i . e', ', Figure 4B ) , they are all activated to nearly the same level in response to dust , and their selection is dependent only on slight differences in dust levels on their corresponding body parts . Once selected , a cleaning module reduces dust on its body part , causing its activation level to drop below that of the next cleaning module', 'That next module is then selected and cleans the associated body part until its own activation level falls below that of another module , and so on . Thus , incremental amounts of dust are removed from body parts while frequent switching occurs among the different modules ( Figure 4B ) . In the case where a hierarchy is set among the cleaning modules ( i . e', ', Figure 4C–D ) , the selection of those that are most hierarchically superior is initially very probable because their activation levels are relatively high in response to the starting amount of dust . As dust is removed , however , these levels among the modules become more similar', 'This equalization of activation levels through dust removal results in return cleaning by the modules , and the simulations shown in Figure 4C , D come to more closely resemble that of Figure 4B as cleaning progresses . Such return cleaning is also seen in wild-type grooming flies , and can thus be explained by our parallel model ( Figure 1E )', 'In addition to simulating the grooming progression , the model recapitulates two other important features of our experimental data . First , it can mimic the constitutive cleaning phenotypes of GAL4 lines expressing dTrpA1 in the absence of dust', 'Constitutive activation was implemented by setting a particular body part to be fully dusted regardless of the amount of cleaning done ( as if the sensory neurons were constantly active ) . This resulted in the continual cleaning of a particular body part without triggering any other cleaning modules ( Figure 4E )', 'Second , the model recapitulates the hierarchical suppression that we observed in our competition experiments ( shown in Figure 3A ) . Adding dust to all body parts in the presence of the constitutive activation of a module and unidirectional inhibitory connections simulated hierarchical suppression', 'This leads to sequential cleaning by the hierarchically superior modules , whereas cleaning by the inferior modules was absent , despite the presence of dust ( Figure 4F )', 'Thus , we find close agreement between the experimental results and the model of grooming behavior , both in the progression of cleaning modules down the hierarchical levels and in the ability of modules higher in the hierarchy to suppress the modules below', 'Our model explains how the sequential selection of cleaning modules occurs , but could it also explain the frequent alternations between cleaning the body parts and leg rubbing that occur throughout the grooming progression ? These alternations are an important and prominent feature in normal grooming behavior for efficient dust removal ( Figure 1E , G , Figure 5A )', 'In order to simulate the alternations , we considered leg rubbing to be a member of the same suppression hierarchy with the other cleaning modules and ran the model simulation based on two premises ( Figure 5B ) . First , leg rubbing occurs at all stages of grooming', 'Therefore , it would necessarily be among the most hierarchically superior of the cleaning modules to be able to suppress cleaning by the others . Second , dust accumulates on the legs while they clean the body parts . This accumulation of dust increases the activation level to the point where leg rubbing is active and the body cleaning modules are subsequently suppressed', 'The removal of dust from the legs through leg rubbing then reduces suppression on the body cleaning modules and allows cleaning of the corresponding body parts to resume . This cyclic accumulation and removal of dust from the legs during body cleaning could account for the high transition probabilities between the leg and body modules', 'When we simulated leg rubbing in the model , the sequential progression of body cleaning modules down the hierarchy was preserved ( Figure 5C ) . The simulation also produced the cyclic alternations between cleaning of a body part and leg rubbing that we observed in our empirically obtained ethograms of wild-type flies ( Figure 5C , D )', 'We conclude that hierarchical relationships among the cleaning modules mediate not only their sequential execution , but also the cyclic transition dynamics between body cleaning and leg rubbing . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 027Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 027 Our model predicts that leg rubbing is among the most hierarchically superior of the cleaning modules', 'Therefore , if leg rubbing is constitutively activated , it should suppress cleaning of the other body parts in a competition experiment where flies are coated in dust . We tested this prediction by using a GAL4 line that drove strong leg rubbing of both the front and hind legs ( Figure 2 , R17F11 )', 'When these flies were coated in dust , they were unable to completely clean their bodies , indicating that the body cleaning modules were suppressed ( Figure 5E , Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) . This supports the prediction that leg rubbing is part of a grooming suppression hierarchy', 'However , cleaning of some body parts were suppressed more than others , suggesting that leg rubbing is not the most superiorly positioned module in the suppressive hierarchy . For example , activated leg rubbing did not suppress eye cleaning . This suggests that eye cleaning is at the top of the grooming hierarchy . Additionally , leg rubbing only weakly suppressed cleaning of the abdomen', 'Given that abdominal cleaning is the most hierarchically superior of the cleaning modules performed by the hind legs , this may suggest that hind leg rubbing and abdominal cleaning are more equal in their positions in the hierarchy', 'These results indicate that our model can explain the main observed features of the grooming progression , including the sequential cleaning of body parts and the frequent alternations between leg rubbing and body part cleaning', 'Hierarchical associations among different available behavioral options allow for those behaviors with the highest value for a given circumstance to be selected while all others are suppressed . These concepts are often referred to as behavioral choice , action selection , motor program selection , or decision making ( Davis , 1979; Redgrave et al', ', 1999; Kupfermann and Weiss , 2001; Kristan , 2008 ) . For example , mollusks will suppress mating in order to feed ( Davis , 1979 ) . This suggests that food is rarer than potential mates , and thus feeding has a higher value than mating . We find that a suppression hierarchy mediates the selection of competing cleaning movements that cannot be executed at the same time', 'The existence of this hierarchy suggests that inherent values are placed on cleaning the different body parts and selecting one over others represents a ‘best’ choice . Eye cleaning is executed first in response to dust and is the most hierarchically superior cleaning module . This suggests a high value for flies to keep their eyes clear of debris', 'Because clean legs are necessary for cleaning each body part , their position near the top of the hierarchy is necessary for efficient debris removal . The antennae may have high value to flies because of the number of different sensory modalities that they house ( e . g . , audition , olfaction , gravity sensing , wind detection ) ( Laissue and Vosshall , 2008; Kamikouchi et al', ', 2009; Yorozu et al . , 2009; Böröczky et al . , 2013; Wilson , 2013 ) . Keeping the abdomen clear of debris is likely critical for respiration as it contains numerous spiracles ( Phillis et al . , 1993; Heymann and Lehmann , 2006 ) . Because of these different values on behavioral motor programs , animals have evolved mechanisms for selecting the most favorable option and suppressing others', 'A significant finding of this work is the experimental demonstration that hierarchical suppression among many behaviors leads to the emergence of a sequence . Although much attention has focused on the role of hierarchical suppression in selecting between behavioral choices , there is little experimental evidence to support its role as a mechanism for eliciting action sequences', 'The grooming sequence may be considered as a series of ‘forced choices’ among different competing cleaning modules that are selected in priority order through suppression . As each body part is cleaned , suppression of the other cleaning modules is lifted , and a new round of competition between the remaining cleaning options occurs', 'Our work lends strong support to an emerging view that hierarchical suppression is a ubiquitous action selection mechanism , whether it is used in deciding among available behavioral choices , or selecting movements performed in complex serial tasks', 'Thus , the evolutionarily ancient ability to select among competing behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided the necessary infrastructure to perform motor actions in sequence ( Houghton and Hartley , 1995 ) . Activation chain and parallel models describe two different mechanisms for generating sequential behavior', 'Activation chains ( sometimes referred to as associative chaining , response chaining , or stimulus-response reflex chaining ) are the simplest form of sequential execution . These work through feedforward activation of the next movement by the previous one ( James , 1890 )', 'Parallel models ( also known as competitive queuing ) select movements through winner-take-all inhibition among the different motor units that are competing for output ( Houghton and Hartley , 1995; Bullock , 2004 ) . Thus , the primary difference between the models is movement selection through either feedforward excitatory or competitive inhibitory mechanisms', 'Two lines of evidence argue against a primary role for an activation chain in driving the dust-induced grooming sequence . First , each cleaning movement can be activated by local stimulation of its respective body part without triggering other movements ( Vandervorst and Ghysen , 1980; Corfas and Dudai , 1989; Kays et al . , 2014 )', 'Either local stimulation ( Figure 3C ) or neuronal activation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3C ) of a particular body part-cleaning module activates only one module and does not trigger the others . Feedforward activation models predict a chain of different cleaning modules once the sequence is triggered rather than just one ( James , 1890; Rhodes et al . , 2004 )', 'Second , the observed structure of grooming behavior in fully dusted flies is inconsistent with an activation chain model . As flies progressively groom their bodies , the transitions among different cleaning modules are gradual ( Figure 1D , E , Figure 1—figure supplement 4B , Figure 4B–D )', 'These gradual transitions are characterized by return cleaning among the modules , meaning that previous cleaning modules are revisited after later modules were already selected . Cleaning modules elicited through feedforward activation are not likely to exhibit such return cleaning , but should produce more deterministic sequences , such as those observed for zebra finch bird song ( Long et al', ', 2010 ) . Although it is possible that activation chains mediate some aspects of grooming behavior , our evidence indicates that a parallel model alone is fully sufficient to reproduce major features of the dust-induced grooming sequence ( discussed below ) . We find that the grooming sequence has features that are similar to parallel models of serial behavior', 'Both involve the parallel activation of premotor units in the sequence . The activation of the cleaning modules occurs through dust sensing , where each module is independently stimulated by a dust stimulus on its corresponding body part . Coating the body of the flies in dust leads to the parallel stimulation of the modules , and thus competition among them', 'Parallel models resolve such simultaneous activation schemes by creating a gradient of activity levels among the units that are executed in the sequence and selecting the one with the highest activity in a winner-take-all network . Our computational model of grooming works through a similar mechanism ( Figure 4A )', 'We find that either differences in the sensory gain of the dust response or unidirectional ( asymmetric ) lateral inhibitory connections among the modules can generate an activity gradient . The most active cleaning module is selected in the winner-take-all layer while the others are suppressed', 'Parallel models propose that the sequence progresses when the selected unit is deleted , and a new round of competition and suppression occurs between the remaining units . In grooming , the active module ‘deletes’ itself from the sequence by reducing the dust stimulated sensory drive through cleaning ( Figure 4A )', 'Thus , all of the major features of parallel models are present in our model of sequential grooming behavior ( parallel activation , competition , activity gradient , winner-take-all selection , and deletion )', 'The finding that grooming behavior displays both sequential and cyclic transitions between modules offers an extension to our understanding of the flexibility of parallel models in producing different types of serial behavior', 'We found that fruit flies make frequent transitions between body cleaning and leg rubbing and that these oscillations can be explained by the same hierarchical rules as those that govern the sequential progression of the behavior ( Figure 5 )', 'The only difference between leg rubbing and body cleaning is that the act of cleaning the body part leads to the transfer of dust to the legs , which then activates leg rubbing ( Figure 5D ) . The cyclic transfer and removal of the dust input leads to oscillatory behavior', 'Thus , simple modifications to the infrastructure underlying parallel models could produce different types of transition dynamics between modules ( i . e . , sequential progression and oscillatory dynamics ) . This demonstrates that these models can generate behaviors of increasing adaptive complexity', 'Does fruit fly grooming behavior provide insight into the organization of more complex motor sequences ? Our model of the grooming progression has features like those proposed to explain learned sequences that also require parallel activation of units that compete for motor output', 'An example of this was derived from studies of human typing that revealed that adjacent letters in a word were often exchanged in error . This suggested that a plan for all the letters necessary to generate a word was readied prior to typing and that execution of each letter competed for output based on a hierarchical prioritization scheme and winner-take-all competition ( Lashley , 1951 )', 'Such studies led to the proposal of parallel models as a way nervous systems implement sequential behavior ( Houghton and Hartley , 1995; Bullock , 2004 ) . To our knowledge , work presented here provides the first evidence of a parallel model in an innate behavior and suggests that this organization may be more widespread than previously thought', 'Putting these concepts together with those discussed about behavioral choice leads to the consideration of the possibility that the neural infrastructure driving simple behavioral choice has served as a framework for the evolution of complex sequential behaviors such as typing ( Houghton and Hartley , 1995 )', 'The unifying feature of these vastly different examples of action selection is hierarchical suppression among competing actions . This raises the possibility that the underlying neural circuits have common organizational features . In this study , we took advantage of the modularity of grooming to interrogate its behavioral organization', 'We gained the experimental control necessary for probing this organization by identifying GAL4 lines that target neurons whose activation drove specific cleaning modules . We show cause and effect experiments indicating that suppressive interactions among the modules govern their selection . Many behaviors are thought to consist of subdivisions of simpler motor programs', 'This approach of acutely manipulating subcomponents of behaviors and assessing how they affect the other components may prove useful for exploring the organization of other complex motor behaviors . Our results do not address the neural circuits that mediate the grooming progression but rather suggest possible types of circuit organization that could underlie its sequential nature', 'Many complex behaviors are likely to involve hundreds or even thousands of neurons and information about the behavioral organization helps focus circuit-mapping efforts on specific features . For example , one prediction of our model of hierarchical suppression points to unidirectional lateral inhibitory connections among the cleaning modules ( Figure 4D )', 'Previous work has demonstrated that such inhibition can occur through direct inhibitory connections from hierarchically superior behavioral circuits to subordinate competing circuits ( Kovac and Davis , 1977 ) . Therefore , it may be reasonable to search for direct inhibitory connections among the cleaning motor programs', 'Alternatively , such inhibition among behavioral motor programs may be due to shared neural circuits . In this case , the activity of a behavioral motor program suppresses another , solely because the shared circuit components cannot drive two behaviors at once ( Briggman and Kristan , 2008 )', 'Future experiments will address whether these or other neural circuit mechanisms govern hierarchical inhibition in serial grooming . Thus , the work presented here provides not only a framework for future experiments to understand how neurons and neural circuits mediate serial grooming , but also a basis for extrapolation to analogous organizational logic in other network-driven sequences', 'The GAL4 lines identified in this study target neurons that activate specific cleaning modules without inducing other behavioral phenotypes . What types of neurons might these GAL4 lines target ? Two types that are already implicated in initiating movements are sensory and command neurons', 'Sensory neurons can activate specific motor programs as the initiators of stimulus-response circuits ( Sherrington , 1906; Huston and Jayaraman , 2011 ) . In fruit fly grooming , mechanosensory neuron-coupled bristles can trigger cleaning responses with mechanical stimulation ( Vandervorst and Ghysen , 1980; Corfas and Dudai , 1989 )', 'This suggests that activation of these sensory neurons with dTrpA1 could trigger the specific cleaning modules . Command neurons have been defined as interneurons that are necessary and sufficient for activating specific motor programs ( Kupfermann and Weiss , 1978 )', 'However , the neurons targeted by the GAL4 lines used in this study only show sufficiency for activating cleaning movements as expression of UAS-Shibirets1 or UAS-TNT were unable to block cleaning ( unpublished data )', 'This may be explained if the GAL4-targeted neurons are those referred to as ‘command-like’ ( also known as command systems , decision neurons , or higher order interneurons ) ( Kupfermann and Weiss , 2001; Kristan , 2008 ) . These neural types are sufficient to activate particular motor programs but do not necessarily fit the strict criteria of also being necessary', 'Thus , we propose that sensory neurons , command-like neurons , or both activate the cleaning modules . The expression patterns of the GAL4 lines in this study vary in the numbers and types of cells that they target , raising the question as to which neurons in each pattern activate the cleaning modules ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 )', 'It is likely that the lines target a mixed population of neurons , where only some are grooming specific . There are examples of GAL4 lines that activate specific behaviors , where only a subset of the neurons within each expression pattern confers the phenotype ( von Philipsborn et al . , 2011; Luan et al . , 2012 )', 'Alternatively , the enhancer fragments used in generating the GAL4 lines might target expression to many different types of neurons involved in the same behavior ( Pfeiffer et al . , 2008 ) . For example , the fruitless gene is expressed in 1500 neurons of different types that comprise elements of a courtship circuit ( Yu et al . , 2010 )', 'Activation of this population of fruitless neurons with dTrpA1 is sufficient to trigger courtship behavior ( Pan et al . , 2011 ) . Further refinement of the expression patterns driven by the GAL4 line enhancers will allow us to distinguish between these possibilities', \"Thus , we anticipate that identifying the neural circuitry for each cleaning module and determining how these circuitries interact will reveal how the serial organization of grooming behavior is encoded in the nervous system through a hierarchical suppression mechanism . \\n Canton S flies were obtained from Martin Heisenberg's lab in Wurzburg , Germany\", \"GAL4 stocks were generated in Gerry Rubin's lab at Janelia Research Campus by methods described previously ( Pfeiffer et al . , 2008 ) and are available at the Bloomington stock center ( Jenett et al . , 2012 )\", 'BDPGAL4U was used as a control for the GAL4 lines in our experiments and contains the vector backbone used to generate the GAL4 collection ( including GAL4 ) but lacks an enhancer to drive its expression . UAS-dTrpA1 ( on the second chromosome ) was obtained from Paul Garrity at Brandeis University ( Hamada et al . , 2008 )', '20xUAS-mCD8::GFP ( JFRC7 ) was constructed as described in Pfeiffer et al . ( 2010 ) . GAL4 lines were crossed to their respective UAS drivers , and both the parents and their progeny were maintained using the following conditions . Flies were reared at 21–22°C and 50% relative humidity using a 16/8 hr light/dark cycle on standard cornmeal and molasses food', 'All experiments were done with 5- to 8-day-old males . Multiwell grooming chambers: blocks of grooming chambers were designed to facilitate the parallel and uniform dusting of flies for dust pattern measurements and recording videos of cleaning behavior . Blocks were fabricated with 24 or 96 grooming chambers ( 15', '6 mm or 7 mm diameters respectively ) and have connector ends and dust removal ends . The connector end has tracks for thin aluminum sliders that gate each chamber to facilitate fly loading ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 )', 'The dust removal end consists of a Nitex mesh-covered opening that allows free dust to exit the chamber while preventing flies from escaping ( Genesee Scientific Corporation , San Diego , California , 630 μm mesh ) . Chambers were printed on a 3D printer', '24-well aluminum chambers ( for cooling experiments ) : aluminum chambers were identical to those described above , with the exception that the dust removal end was closed such that flies would stand directly on the aluminum ( shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1E , F ) . These chambers were fabricated for rapid cooling of flies to quickly shut off dTrpA1-activated behaviors', 'Design plans for the grooming chambers are available in Supplementary file 1 . All experiments were carried out in a warm room that was set to 30–32°C . Flies were cold anesthetized ( 1–2°C ) , transferred to grooming chambers ( single fly per chamber ) , and allowed to recover for at least 15 min before assaying', 'Flies were tapped from the chambers into multiwell plates containing measured amounts of Reactive Yellow 86 dust ( Organic Dyestuffs Corporation , Concord , North Carolina ) and shaken to uniformly coat each fly ( Phillis et al . , 1993 ) . Excess dust was removed by tapping the flies against the mesh on the dust removal end of the grooming block', 'The flies were then allowed to clean in the chambers with the mesh side down to allow dust to exit . Video recordings of flies were made with a clear acrylic plug covering the adaptor end of the chamber ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1D ) . Grooming was terminated at different time points by anesthetizing the flies with CO2', '0-min time samples were obtained by dusting the flies and immediately anesthetizing them . Data were acquired from at least four separate crosses . 25 min was chosen as the assay end because most body parts were clean at that point . Dusted flies were prepared as described above and dissected for imaging of their dust patterns', 'The dissection procedure made it impossible to image the entire body surface of a single fly . Each part was dissected as described below . Heads: flies were decapitated using a razor blade , and the heads were affixed face up to a cover slip with double-sided tape ( 3M Corporation , St . Paul , Minnesota )', 'Wings: the left ( lateral ) wings were removed by grasping the base with a pair of forceps and pulling it off with an adjacent pair of forceps . They were affixed dorsal side up to a cover slip with double-sided tape . Ventral abdomen: dissected and imaged shortly after performing grooming assays because the abdomens desiccated quickly', \"Flies were held on their sides with a scalpel inserted between the head and thorax while all legs and wings were removed .

Next , the thorax and dorsal abdomen were glued to a cover slip such that the ventral abdomen was facing up using Elmer's No-Wrinkle Rubber Cement ( Elmer’s Products , Inc . , Columbus , Ohio )\", 'Dorsal abdomen: flies were held on their sides and the ventral side of the thorax and legs were severed from the dorsal side along a plane that was parallel to the abdomen . The wings were removed and the abdomen was glued dorsal side up . Thoraces: no dissection was necessary for imaging thoraces . They were imaged in specially designed chamber that would hold all flies uniformly dorsal side up', 'Standard preparations and example dirty samples for each body part are displayed in Figure 1B . Body parts were imaged using a Zeiss SteREO Discovery . V12 equipped with an Achromat S 1 . 0× objective ( Carl Zeiss Corporation , Oberkochen , Germany ) .

The contrast was then adjusted to 100% to set all dust pixels to a 255 grayscale value ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ) . To visually display the average dust patterns , we used custom Matlab ( MathWorks , Inc', ', Natick , Massachusetts ) code ( Groomogram ) to generate average projections ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2C , code included as Source code 1 ) . Groomogram code works by averaging the grayscale pixel values ( 0 = no dust/255 = dust ) for each pixel coordinate from all experimental images', 'The average pixel values for the entire image were converted to grayscale colormaps that represent the percent of flies with dust at a particular pixel coordinate ( Figure 1B , Figure 1—figure supplement 2D )', 'Calculating normalized dust pixels in a specified region: pixels with 255 grayscale values ( dust pixels ) , and located within the regions designated by standard masks were counted for each image ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A , B ) .

Standard error was calculated from these values . Normalization in Figure 3B was calculated as follows: average dust pixel fractions per body region were divided by the maximum mean value for each body part', 'The ventral and dorsal abdominal data were combined for display in Figure 3B by calculating the mean of their normalized values . Camera setup: an Edmund Optics 1312C color USB camera ( Edmund Optics Corporation , Barrington , New Jersey ) equipped with a Computar 25 mm f1', '4 lens and an EX2C extender for C-mount ( CBC AMERICA Corporation , Commack , New York ) was used to record flies at 30 frames per second . dTrpA1 behavioral analysis ( undusted flies ) : this method was used for recording the flies shown in Figure 2', 'Flies were cold anesthetized at 1–2°C and placed into a 3 mm high and 13 mm diameter arena sitting directly on a teca solid state heat/cool cold plate ( TECA Corporation , Chicago , Illinois )', 'The flies were allowed at least 5 min to recover from the cold anesthesia and then recorded for 2 min when the cold plate temperature sensor read 21°C , 30°C , and then 21°C ( post activation analysis ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . Dusted experiments: Canton S or GAL4/UAS-dTrpA1 flies were dusted individually in 24-well grooming chambers as described above', 'An acrylic plug was inserted into the hole on the adapter end and the aluminum slider was removed such that the fly could be recorded ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1D ) . Flies were also shaken without dust and recorded as a control for the behavioral effects of the shaking', 'Dusted/cooled experiments: flies were shaken with or without dust , allowed to groom for 25 min at 30°C , cooled to 18°C , and their behavior was recorded for 3 min . After grooming for 24 min at 30°C , the flies were transferred to a 24-well aluminum grooming block that was preheated to 30°C', 'Just before 25 min , an acrylic plug was placed over the chamber opening and the block was placed on a TECA cold plate that was set to 18°C to rapidly cool the flies and shut off the dTrpA1 channel . Cleaning movements were scored for 3 min starting when the plate touched the cold plate surface ( Figure 3C , Figure 3—figure supplement 3 )', 'Pre-recorded video was manually scored using Noldus Observer XT 7 . 0 software ( Noldus Information Technology , Wageningen , Netherlands ) . A list of cleaning movements was compiled and modified from two different studies ( Szebenyi , 1969; Dawkins and Dawkins , 1976 ) . Flies clean their bodies with their front or hind legs as mutually exclusive events ( Figure 1A )', 'Front leg cleaning movements are directed to the head whereas the hind legs clean the abdomen , wings , and thoraces . Starts of cleaning events are defined when the legs are farthest anterior ( hind leg movements ) or posterior ( front leg movements ) of the body part before they sweep in the opposite direction . Transitions between movements were included at the end of the preceding movement', 'Wing cleaning with the hind legs and leg rubbing using the second legs were sometimes asymmetrically performed in that one leg performed cleaning of a particular body part while the contralateral leg was stationary . Eye and head cleaning: legs sweep across the eyes , tops , and bottoms of the head as it is rotated . Most sweeps across the eyes occur in the absence of head rotation', 'Antennae: legs are directed towards the antennal region , often while the head is tilted slightly forward . The legs sometimes grab the antennae and pull them away from the head . Proboscis: sweeps down the length of the extended proboscis . The amount of proboscis extension does not factor into the definition as long as it is partially extended or seen moving with the legs', 'Ventral head: legs sweep the ventral side of the head with no proboscis extension . The front legs almost always sweep the bottom of the head/proboscis in parallel . Note , proboscis and ventral head cleaning were binned with eye and head cleaning for simplicity . Whole head: all of the head cleaning behaviors described above are binned', 'The whole head designation was used because it was not possible to distinguish between eye , head , and antennal cleaning when flies were dusted . Abdominal cleaning: legs sweep the ventral or dorsal surface of the abdomen . The hind legs sometimes clean the genitals . This was included as abdominal cleaning for simplicity', 'Wing cleaning: each leg sweeps the ipsilateral dorsal side of the wings simultaneously , or one at a time . Alternatively , both legs clean a single wing with the ipsilateral leg cleaning the dorsal side and the contralateral leg cleaning the ventral side . Sweeping or kicking the ventral part of the wing with one or both legs was also referred to as wing cleaning', 'In this case , as the legs sweep anterior to posterior , the wings lift away from the body . Thoracic cleaning: hind legs sweep the thorax from anterior to posterior with one or both legs . Front/hind leg rubbing: distal parts of the legs are rubbed together . Behavior begins at the moment that the legs touch each other', 'If the legs stop motion but remain together , it is defined as leg rubbing as long as they do not touch the ground . The middle legs were sometimes rubbed together with the front or the hind legs . This was included with front leg or hind leg rubbing depending on the leg pair being used with the second legs', 'Standing: fly does not move more than a body length from the original scored position and does not perform any grooming movements . The beginning of standing is scored as soon as the last leg touches the ground . In some cases , the legs did not touch the ground to initiate the behavior and instead was scored at the point where the previous behavior was judged to have ceased', 'Walking: fly steps more than a body length with no pauses in leg movement . Walking is also defined as moving from one of the following locations in the chamber to another ( floor , ceiling , or side ) . The beginning of walking is scored at the moment that one of the front legs initiates a step . Manually scored behavioral video was analyzed as follows', 'Bout frequency: total number of starts of each behavior per fly . Bout frequency per interval: bout starts that fell within a designated time interval . Marginal probability: the average fraction of total bouts of a particular behavior . Change from control: the experimental parameter ( either bout frequency or fraction of time ) was subtracted from the control', 'Statistical test: control and experimental flies were compared using a Kruskal–Wallis test . Post-hoc Mann–Whitney U pairwise tests were then performed with Bonferroni correction . Transition probability: calculated by counting the number of transitions from each behavior to each other behavior', 'Next , we calculated the fraction of times that behavior i transitioned to behavior j given the total of number of transitions to all behaviors . Therefore , the probability of going from behavior i to all other behaviors sums to 1 . GAL4 lines used in this study were obtained from a screen designed to identify and manipulate neural circuitry involved in grooming behavior', 'We used a collection of enhancer-driven GAL4 lines to genetically target different subsets of neurons with the neural activator UAS-dTrpA1 ( Hamada et al . , 2008; Pfeiffer et al . , 2008; Jenett et al . , 2012 ) . Over 1500 GAL4 lines expressing dTrpA1 were manually examined at 30–32°C for increased grooming compared with wild type', 'We manually scored the movements of 12 identified GAL4 lines that were sufficient to activate strong cleaning movements ( Figure 2 ) . GAL4 lines used in this study were sufficient to activate cleaning movements but not necessary for cleaning dust off their respective body parts . This was revealed by inhibition and dusting experiments using both UAS-Shibirets1 or UAS-TNT ( data not shown )', 'GAL4 lines expressing GFP were stained and their patterns imaged using previously published methods ( Pfeiffer et al . , 2010 ) . Two neural network architectures were used to simulate the hierarchical suppression among competing cleaning modules: a sensory gain model ( SGM , Figure 4C ) and a unidirectional inhibition model ( UIM , Figure 4D )', 'Both neural networks were implemented using Matlab 7 ( code included as Source code 2 ) . Both networks are based on three layers: sensory layer , hierarchical layer , and winner-take-all layer . Sensory and hierarchical layers: for both network implementations , we defined a vector of activation levels , a , to represent N neural modules ( this is the hierarchical layer )', 'For the UIM architecture , the activation levels are initially set to equal the vector of amounts of dust , d ( this is the sensory input layer ) . The initial amount of dust was set to 0 . 9 + r , where r is a random value between 0 and 0 . 1 , sampled from uniform distribution', 'This noise term is only a factor in Figure 4B ( no hierarchy set among the modules ) where slight differences in the relative dust levels determine which module is selected first . While for the SGM architecture , the vector a = dws , where ws is the vector of sensory weights', 'In UIM , ws is set to one ( no sensory gain differences ) and vector a is then multiplied by the N × N weight matrix , W , of which the diagonal = 1 , and the upper triangle is populated by equal negative weights , w = −0 . 5 . For SGM , ws is set to ws = [wmax , w1 , w2 , … wmin] , which insures that the sensory weights decrease from the first module to the last', 'Thus , for each iteration i , we update the activation levels as follows:ai+1=diws , SGMai+1=aiW , UIM For simulating no hierarchical differences among the modules ( shown Figure 4B ) , we set ws to 1 , and the upper triangle of W to 0', 'Winner-take-all layer: to simulate removal of dust from the body parts , this layer first finds the module with the highest activation level that was set by SGM or UIM . The position of the module with maximal activation level , ma , is determined: ma = max ( a )', 'The winner-take-all layer is then simply a binary vector e containing all zeros and equals 1 only in the position ma , thus pointing to the body part where cleaning behavior will be executed . Next , a constant amount of dust , dr , is subtracted from the math position in vector d ( dma )', 'Thus , for each iteration i: Note: we did not explicitly simulate the circuitry required for implementation of the winner-take-all layer . Instead , we selected the module with maximal activation level ( ma ) by simply using the Matlab max ( ) function', 'Winner-take-all neural networks can be modeled using all-to-all inhibitory connections between the different modules ( Houghton and Hartley , 1995 ) . Such explicit simulations of winner-take-all function might capture the empirically observed behavior even better but would require more complex modeling , going beyond the scope of the claims presented in this work', 'Constitutive activation of cleaning modules: to implement constitutive cleaning of a particular body part , we held the dust level of a given cleaning module constant ( at maximum dust level ) ( Figure 4E , F ) . This models the situation where the fly is receiving constant sensory input even in the absence of stimulus . Leg rubbing: to implement leg rubbing , we assumed two pairs of legs', 'Both pairs were assigned an initial activation level ( al; a 2 dimensional vector ) , which was directly proportional to the amount of dust on legs ( dl ) . For each iteration i , we added a small , constant amount of dust to the pair of legs assigned to clean the body part with the maximal activation level ( ma )', 'If ma =< 3 ( ‘anterior body parts’ ) the first leg pair was assigned and if ma > 3 ( ‘posterior body parts’ ) the second leg pair was assigned to collect dust . Therefore , with each grooming iteration , the activation level of the associated pair of legs increases', 'Leg rubbing ( removal of dust from legs themselves ) is initiated under two conditions: ( 1 ) the activation level of the pair crosses a stationary threshold ( same for both pairs ) and ( 2 ) the activation level of the pair is above the activation level of any body part ( above ma ) , including the other pair of legs', 'The latter condition assures that leg rubbing is still part of the competitive hierarchy of cleaning modules ( Figure 5C , D ) . Model output and display: the output of the model is the position of the cleaning module with the maximum activation level at iteration i ( mai )', 'Thus the output is an array with rows corresponding to mai ( active cleaning module ) and columns corresponding to iteration i ( ‘time’ ) . This array was used to generate the ethograms shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 .']\n",

The problem is that prospero mutants show de-differentiation of GMCs into proliferating neuroblasts ( Choksi et al . , 2006; Lee et al . , 2006 ) , making it necessary to distinguish the parental neuroblasts from the de-differentiated GMCs', 'To resolve the issue , we used the Notch signaling reporter , mγ-LacZ ( Wech et al . , 1999; Cooper et al . , 2000 ) , to identify the parental neuroblasts . During neuroblast asymmetric cell division , Miranda-Prospero and Partner of numb ( Pon ) -Numb protein complexes are independently segregated into the GMC to promote differentiation ( Doe , 2008 )', 'In prospero mutants , Numb is still properly segregated to GMCs where it represses Notch activity ( Spana and Doe , 1995 ) and consequently the Notch reporter mγ-LacZ is restricted to parental neuroblasts', 'mγ-LacZ is transcribed only in neuroblasts; in wild type the protein perdures into neuroblast progeny , whereas in prospero mutants the protein is restricted to neuroblasts because the progeny proliferate without expressing mγ-LacZ and thus dilute out the protein ( Choksi et al . , 2006; Figure 3A , B ) . Thus , we scored for EdU incorporation in the mγ-LacZ+ parental neuroblasts', 'Whereas in wild type nearly all neuroblasts ceased EdU incorporation by stage 16 ( Figure 3A ) , many mγ-LacZ+ neuroblasts continued to incorporate EdU in prospero mutants at the same stage ( Figure 3B ) . This strongly supports a model in which Prospero is required for neuroblast entry into quiescence', 'In addition , Prospero is unique among basal cell fate determinants in regulating neuroblast quiescence: loss of function mutations in numb or brat , or the Prospero target gene string , showed no effect on the timing of neuroblast quiescence ( data not shown ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03363 . 008Figure 3 .

We used mγ-LacZ , Miranda , and EdU incorporation to assay the timing of NB3-3T quiescence in wild type and prospero mutant embryos', 'In both wild type and prospero haplo-insufficiency embryos , the mγ-LacZ+ NB3-3T was proliferative at stage 14 and quiescent by stage 16 ( Figure 3C , quantified in Figure 3E ) . In prospero mutant embryos , the mγ-LacZ+ NB3-3T was proliferative at both stage 14 and 16 ( Figure 3D , quantified in Figure 3E )', 'The results suggest that the level of Prospero required for neuroblast quiescence is lower than that in prospero haplo-insufficiency and that a low level of Prospero is sufficient to promote neuroblast quiescence ( see next section ) . We conclude that Prospero is required for neuroblast quiescence', 'The central brain neuroblasts are continuously proliferating during the third larval instar ( Ito and Hotta , 1992 ) , and so we used this stage to determine whether transient Prospero expression could induce neuroblast quiescence . We used the TARGET method ( McGuire et al', ', 2003 ) to transiently induce Prospero expression for 2 hr , and then assayed for neuroblast quiescence 12 hr later ( Figure 4 ) . Because high levels of Prospero can induce neuroblast differentiation ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) ( Choksi et al . , 2006; Cabernard and Doe , 2009; Bayraktar et al', ', 2010 ) , we used Prospero levels low enough to minimize neuroblast differentiation , as shown by the persistence of most Deadpan+ neuroblasts after misexpression ( Figure 4D )', 'We identified quiescent neuroblasts by their failure to incorporate EdU , lack of progenitor marker Worniu , and lack of the differentiation marker Elav—together a robust signature for quiescent neuroblasts ( see Figure 1 ) . In wild-type larval brains , we found few or no quiescent neuroblasts , as expected ( Figure 4E , F )', 'In contrast , a pulse of Prospero resulted in the appearance of numerous quiescent neuroblasts ( Figure 4E , F; 12 hr timepoint ) . To rule out the possibility that these ‘quiescent neuroblasts’ were early in the differentiation pathway , we reasoned that if they were quiescent they could reactivate proliferation in a nourishing environment ( Chell and Brand , 2010; Sousa-Nunes et al', ', 2010 ) whereas if they were differentiating they would never re-enter the cell cycle . Thus , we exposed larval neuroblasts to the same 2 hr pulse of Prospero , but waited 24 hr to assay neuroblasts . We found that nearly all of the neuroblasts that were quiescent at 12 hr after induction had reactivated proliferation and re-expressed progenitor markers ( Figure 4E , F; 24 hr timepoint )', 'In addition , precocious low level nuclear Prospero could advance the timing of NB3-3T quiescence ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . We conclude that transient , low-level nuclear Prospero is sufficient to induce neuroblast quiescence', 'Interestingly , Prospero can also transiently arrest the cell cycle without inducing differentiation in embryonic longitudinal glial progenitors ( Griffiths and Hidalgo , 2004 ) , although the relative levels of Prospero have not been explored in this system . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03363 . 009Figure 4 .

      "\t ['Virtually all species of coelomate animals contain blood cells that display a division of labor necessary for homeostasis . This functional partition depends upon the balance between proliferation and differentiation mostly accomplished in the hematopoietic organs . In Drosophila melanogaster , the lymph gland produces plasmatocytes and crystal cells that are not released until pupariation', 'Yet , throughout larval development , both hemocyte types increase in numbers . Mature plasmatocytes can proliferate but it is not known if crystal cell numbers increase by self-renewal or by de novo differentiation . We show that new crystal cells in third instar larvae originate through a Notch-dependent process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation', 'This process occurs in the sessile clusters and is contingent upon the integrity of these structures . The existence of this hematopoietic tissue , relying on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis , creates a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in Drosophila hematopoiesis and establishing further parallels with vertebrate systems', 'In insects , the functions of hemocytes ( blood cells ) are very diverse and include phagocytosis , extracellular matrix deposition , AMP production , encapsulation , and melanization . Similarly to what happens in vertebrates , the different functions performed by insect hemocytes are , to some degree , compartmentalized into different cell types ( Honti et al . , 2014 )', 'Some mature blood cells retain the ability to divide when in circulation , but the majority of blood cell proliferation and differentiation occurs in the hematopoietic organs ( Grigorian and Hartenstein , 2013 )', 'These organs provide the correct cellular and molecular environment for the control of cell proliferation and differentiation , namely in the so-called stem cell niches ( Koch and Radtke , 2007; Martinez-Agosto et al . , 2007 )', 'Thus , the study of hematopoietic organs structure and function is essential to understand how different mature blood cells arise and how their absolute and relative numbers are controlled . In Drosophila melanogaster , embryonic hematopoiesis produces two different types of mature hemocytes: plasmatocytes and crystal cells', 'Plasmatocytes are phagocytic cells often functionally compared to vertebrate macrophages ( Evans et al . , 2003 ) . Crystal cells are non-phagocytic cells known to produce prophenoloxidase , an essential component of the melanization cascade ( Binggeli et al . , 2014 ) . Both plasmatocytes and crystal cells generated during embryogenesis persist into larval stages', 'Hemocytes in the larva can be found in circulation but the majority of them are attached to the cuticular epidermis as sessile cells ( Lanot et al . , 2001; Kurucz et al . , 2007b; Makhijani et al . , 2011 ) . Hemocytes attached to the epidermis are not randomly dispersed but form stereotypical clusters of cells in every segment of the larva ( Zettervall et al . , 2004; Makhijani et al', ', 2011 ) indicating that some signal must direct hemocytes to these locations . In fact , it has been recently shown that peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) neurons attract hemocytes and provide unknown trophic molecules for their survival ( Makhijani et al . , 2011 )', 'The larva also possesses a hematopoietic organ , the lymph gland , where plasmatocytes and crystal cells differentiate from prohemocytes ( Crozatier and Meister , 2007 )', 'Prohemocytes residing in the medullary zone of the lymph gland are instructed by cells from the posterior signaling center ( PSC ) to maintain their quiescent state or to differentiate into mature plasmatocytes or crystal cells ( Crozatier et al . , 2004; Mandal et al . , 2007 )', 'During the differentiation process , it has been suggested that cells migrate and occupy the most cortical zone of the lymph gland ( Jung et al . , 2005; Krzemien et al . , 2010b )', 'An essential aspect of the Drosophila larval hematopoiesis is that hemocytes produced in the lymph gland do not disperse from the organ until pupariation or upon injury such as parasitoid wasp egg infection ( Holz et al . , 2003; Honti et al . , 2010 )', 'Hence , in homeostatic conditions , differentiated hemocytes in the lymph gland do not contribute to the circulating and sessile hemocyte population . Nonetheless , the hemocyte population found in circulation and in sessile patches expands throughout larval development . Plasmatocytes are mitotically active cells ( Rizki , 1957; Lanot et al', ', 2001 ) expanding during larval development by self renewal ( Makhijani et al . , 2011 ) . On the other hand , all reports thus far concur in that mature crystal cells do not divide during larval stages ( Krzemien et al . , 2010b; Lanot et al . , 2001; Rizki , 1957 ) , although they have been shown to proliferate during embryogenesis ( Lebestky et al . , 2000 )', 'Further characterization of a yet unknown source and undetermined mechanism of crystal cell differentiation is required to understand how its number increases during larval development . Although little is known on how crystal cells are formed outside the lymph gland , it has been shown that Notch signaling is necessary to form these cells ( Duvic et al . , 2002; Lebestky et al . , 2003 )', 'In the lymph gland , the role of Notch signaling in crystal cell formation is cell autonomous ( Mukherjee et al . , 2011 ) . Notch activation is sufficient in hemocytes to induce the expression of lozenge , the first known transcription factor in crystal cell development ( Lebestky et al . , 2000 )', 'One particularity of Notch signaling is that it requires cell contact since the two known Drosophila Notch ligands , Serrate and Delta , are membrane bound proteins ( Fiúza and Arias , 2007 ) . In the lymph gland , Serrate-positive hemocytes induce neighboring cells to adopt crystal cell fates ( Lebestky et al . , 2003; Mukherjee et al . , 2011; Ferguson & Martinez-agosto 2014 )', 'Outside the lymph gland , only in sessile clusters may we observe hemocytes establishing stable cell–cell contacts between them ( Lanot et al . , 2001 ) . In fact , hemocytes in clusters are densely packed and linked through interdigitations ( Lanot et al . , 2001 ) , particularly in the last two abdominal larval segments , the putative posterior hematopoietic tissue ( PHT ) ( Kurucz et al', ', 2007 ) . Indeed , in recent years , the idea that hematopoietic properties must reside outside of the lymph gland has been put forward explicitly by the Andó laboratory ( Márkus et al . , 2009 ) . Firstly , in a descriptive endeavor by Kurucz et al', '( 2007 ) where an operational posterior hematopoietic tissue ( PHT ) consisting of the sessile hemocyte clusters in the last two abdominal segments is postulated; and later in a set of experiments showing that hemocytes taken from these clusters have the ability to differentiate into lamellocytes upon transfer to a different larva ( Márkus et al . , 2009; Honti et al . , 2010 )', 'Importantly , sessile hemocytes in clusters constitute the biggest compartment of hemocytes in the larva ( Lanot et al . , 2001; Makhijani et al . , 2011 ) , contained within epidermal and muscle tissue in a structure that has been called hematopoietic pockets ( Makhijani et al . , 2011 )', 'Moreover , the sessile plasmatocytes in such clusters have a higher division rate than those in circulation ( Makhijani et al . , 2011 ) . However , to consider the hemocyte clusters as a bona fide hematopoietic tissue , evidence is needed that their structure is necessary to control cell proliferation and/or cell fate decisions', 'In this study , we directly test the hypothesis that the hemocyte clusters constitute a hematopoietic tissue by addressing systematically the following questions: ( i ) are crystal cells differentiating in these clusters ? ( ii ) is the structure/architecture of these clusters necessary for this function ? and ( iii ) what is the role of the Notch pathway in this hematopoietic role ? \\n In homeostatic conditions , the embryonic-derived hemocyte population consists of plasmatocytes and crystal cells', 'It is possible to distinguish these two cell types with several combinations of cell markers ( Lebestky et al . , 2000 ) such as the two live genetic drivers: HemolectinΔ-nuclearDsRed ( Clark et al . , 2011 ) and Lozenge-GAL4 in combination with UAS-EGFP/mCD8GFP ( Lebestky et al . , 2000 )', 'With this combination of markers we can distinguish across the larval cuticle , Hml+Lz− from Hml+Lz+ sessile hemocytes ( Figure 1A , A′ ) . Lozenge is the first marker known in the genetic cascade that leads to crystal cell differentiation and its expression is maintained as the cell matures ( Lebestky et al . , 2000 )', 'Hemolectin promoter has been used in different Drosophila transgenic lines to mark the majority of hemocytes ( Sinenko and Mathey-Prevot , 2004; Clark et al . , 2011 ) . Hence , Hml+Lz+ cells are fully mature crystal cells or differentiating crystal cells while Hml+Lz− cells are plasmatocytes . During maturation , crystal cells loose HmlΔ-GAL4 expression ( Mukherjee et al . , 2011 )', 'The same is observed with HmlΔ-nuclearDsRed but only in rare cells . This difference may be explained by the different degradation times of nuclearDsRed and cytoplasmatic GFP . In fact , it is possible to detect a higher proportion of Hml−Lz+ cells with HmlΔ-cytoplasmaticDsRed ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 )', 'Another characteristic that distinguishes plasmatocytes from crystal cells is that the former tend to increase in size as they mature ( Terriente-Felix et al . , 2013 ) . Measuring hemocytes cell areas in the three different populations of cells , we can observe a clear difference in size distributions between Hml+Lz− , Hml+Lz+ , and Hml−Lz+ cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife', '06166 . 003Figure 1 .

Here , we focus on third instar larvae because this is the developmental window in which the majority of larval hemocytes are originated ( Lanot et al . , 2001; Makhijani et al', ', 2011 ) . Moreover , at this stage we could develop reliable in vivo imaging procedures that render our analysis and interpretations more pertinent ( see below ) . It has been suggested repeatedly that during larval stages mature crystal cells are post-mitotic ( Rizki , 1957; Lanot et al . , 2001 ) making it reasonable to assume that new crystal cells differentiate as development proceeds', 'This can be achieved by inducing new crystal cell precursors , proliferation of crystal cell precursors or simply by maturation of precursor cells already present in the larval body cavity . The earliest known marker predictive of crystal cell differentiation is Lozenge and it has been reported that during embryogenesis Lz+ cells can proliferate ( Lebestky et al . , 2000 )', 'We checked whether Lz+ cells increase in number throughout third instar larval development or if their number is fixed and crystal cells mature from these precursors . We counted the total number of sessile hemocytes in the HmlΔ-nuclearDsRed LzGAL4>GFP/mCD8GFP larvae ( see ‘Materials and methods’ )', 'We could confirm that Hml+ cells increase as third instar larval development proceeds , both in males and females ( Figure 1B ) . The number of Lz+ cells also increases in the same time period ( Figure 1B ) . In females there is no difference in the number of Lz+ in the last 16 hr of development', 'With this , late third stage larva females have less crystal cells than males which is not common in the majority of fly stocks where females tend to have a higher number of crystal cells than males ( see ‘Results’ below )', 'Nevertheless , the results clearly show that committed crystal cells ( Hml+Lz+ ) are increasing in number during third instar larval development , in parallel with an expansion of the plasmatocyte ( Hml+Lz− ) population . Next , we wanted to distinguish if Lz+ cells expand by cell proliferation or by de novo differentiation from Hml+Lz− cells', 'A way to achieve this is to directly visualize hemocyte clusters with live time-lapse imaging and calculate the proliferation and differentiation rates for each cell type . To that purpose , we developed a method for imaging epidermal hemocyte clusters in live larvae for periods of 3 hr', 'HmlΔ-nuclearDsRed; Lz-GAL4>EGFP/mCD8GFP early L3 male larvae ( <12 hr after L3 ecdysis ) were selected and prepared for imaging ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ) . As expected , it was possible to see the division of Hml+Lz− cell nuclei ( Arrows in Figure 1C )', 'Throughout this 3-hr period , we estimate that ∼7% of Hml+Lz− cells divide ( n = 13 videos with mean 50 Hml+Lz− and 6 Hml+Lz+ cells per video ) . No case of Hml+Lz+ cell division was seen in any video . Since the number of Lz+ cells per video is small , we analyzed an extra set of videos to check only for Lz+ cell divisions ( 7 videos , 118 Lz+ cells analyzed through a 3-hr period )', 'Still , no Lz+ cell division was observed . This suggests that Hml+Lz+ sessile cells in dorsal clusters divide at an extremely low frequency or are post mitotic cells . In contrast , we confirm that plasmatocytes ( Hml+Lz− ) proliferate within sessile clusters as previously reported ( Honti et al . , 2010; Makhijani et al . , 2011 )', 'Notably , it was possible to see induction of GFP in GFP− cells , demonstrating that an Hml+Lz− cell is turning into an Hml+Lz+ cell ( Arrowhead in Figure 1C ) ( see Video 1 ) . During our analysis cells that start with low expression tend to increase it with time ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 )', 'When we bleed larvae and analyze Hml+Lz+ cells , we also see a tendency for larger cells to have more GFP , measured by mean grey value of the picture ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . If larger cells had the same GFP signal they would have a lower mean grey value because the signal would be diluted', 'In conjugation , these results indicate that lozenge expression starts in Hml+Lz− cells morphologically indistinct from plasmatocytes and increases together with cell size as crystal cell maturation progresses . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06166 . 008Video 1 .

The proportion of Hml+Lz+-induced cells in our videos is ∼3 . 5% in 3 hr', 'Knowing the differentiation rate of Hml+Lz− into Hml+Lz+ , we can extrapolate the number of Hml+Lz+ cells differentiated from Hml+Lz− cells at given time ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ) . The differentiation rate calculated in our video analysis is sufficient to explain the increase in Hml+Lz+ cell number observed in the first 24 hr of third instar larval development', 'The mean increase of Lz+ cells measured during development is 256 . 4 cells ( Figure 1B ) and the extrapolation gives an increase of 447 Lz+ cells . On the whole , the analysis of these videos shows that Hml+Lz+ cells differentiate from Hml+Lz− cells in hemocyte clusters at a rate that is sufficient to explain the increase in this cell type observed in the first 24 hr of L3 development', 'Only a small proportion of Hml+Lz− cells become Hml+Lz+ in the course of third instar larval development . An important element to clarify is whether all Hml+Lz− cells have the capacity to become Hml+Lz+ cells or whether this property is exclusive of a subpopulation of Hml+Lz− cells', 'In the time window of interest , hemocytes can be divided into two sub-populations , NimrodC1+ and NimrodC1− ( Kurucz et al . , 2007; Csordás et al . , 2014 ) . During lymph gland development , Nimrod is only detectable in mature plasmatocytes and it is not expressed in Lz+ cells ( Terriente-Felix et al . , 2013; Ferguson & Martinez-agosto 2014 )', 'Thus , in the lymph gland Lz+ cells differentiate from Hml+Nimrod− cells . To test if Nimrod− hemocytes in sessile clusters are the precursors of Lz+ cells , we checked for Nimrod protein ( P1 antibody , see details in ‘Materials and methods’ ) in Lz+ sessile cells . It is worth noticing that , because crystal cells burst after bleeding ( Bidla et al', ', 2007 ) , there is a bias in immunofluorescence stainings in favor of more immature crystal cells . Contrarily to the lymph gland , the majority of Lz+ cells are also Nimrod+ ( Figure 2A–A″ ) . This result suggests that Lz+ cells differentiate from a pool of mature plasmatocytes . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06166 . 009Figure 2 .

In this case , cells that are phagocytically active become non-phagocytic and start to express lamellocyte markers ( Honti et al . , 2010 )', 'Given this , we proceeded to test if the observed transition between Lz− and Lz+ corresponds to a change of fate from plasmatocyte ( phagocytic ) to crystal cell ( non-phagocytic ) . From our results , it is evident that phagocytosis index is higher in Lz− hemocytes but it is still non-negligible in Lz+ hemocytes ( Figure 2B )', 'When we characterize cell area and GFP intensity in Lz+ cells , it is possible to observe that the smaller and GFPlow expressing cells are able to phagocyte bacteria ( Figure 2B′ ) . Large cells that have GFPhigh expression are virtually non-phagocytic cells . This indicates that induced Lz+ cells are plasmatocytes with phagocytic activity , which is lost as they mature into crystal cells', 'Altogether , these results support the transdifferentiation of mature phagocytically active plasmatocytes into non-phagocytic crystal cells . As mentioned above , crystal cell numbers are reduced in larvae raised at a restrictive temperature in a thermo sensitive Notch allele background ( Duvic et al . , 2002 ) . This reduction is visible in sessile hemocytes and in the lymph gland ( Duvic et al', ', 2002; Lebestky et al . , 2003 ) . In the lymph gland Notch signaling has a cell autonomous role on Hml+Lz− cells ( Mukherjee et al . , 2011 ) . To test for the role of the Notch pathway in the differentiation of crystal cells in the clusters , we used RNAi exclusively in hemocytes by way of the HmlΔGAL4 driver', 'Firstly , we establish that Notch downregulation reduces the number of sessile crystal cells both in females ( Figure 3A ) and males ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . As mentioned above , in this experiment it is possible to observe that sessile crystal cell numbers are higher in females ( compare controls in Figure 2A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 )', 'In Drosophila , Notch is activated by two different ligands: Serrate and Delta ( Fiúza and Arias , 2007 ) . Only Serrate mutants have reduced numbers of embryonically derived crystal cell ( Duvic et al . , 2002; Lebestky et al . , 2003 )', 'Similarly , knocking down Serrate in hemocytes ( HmlΔ-GAL4>UAS-Serrate RNAi ) reduces the number of crystal cells to a similar level than found using Notch RNAi , as opposed to disrupting Delta function ( Figure 3A ) . This indicates that Serrate , the ligand necessary to induce Notch signaling in hemocytes , interestingly , it is expressed in the hemocytes themselves . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06166', '010Figure 3 .

In the lymph gland , Notch activation is essential to induce lozenge upregulation ( Lebestky et al . , 2003 ) . As observed in the lymph gland ( Terriente-Felix et al', ', 2013 ) , we can detect Notch enhancer GFP reporters in Lz+ sessile hemocytes and , using video analysis , we can observe induction of lozenge in Notch activated cells ( Figure 3B )', 'To confirm that Notch knockdown inhibits the induction of lozenge in sessile hemocytes and not the maturation of Lz+ cells into crystal cells , we measured the proportion of Lz+ cells with anti-Lozenge antibody while inhibiting Notch expression in all hemocytes ( HmlΔ-GAL4>NotchRNAi ) . The proportion of Lz+ cells in this case is clearly reduced ( Figure 3C )', 'Because increased crystal cell apoptosis could also explain the reduced crystal cell numbers , we estimated hemocyte apoptosis upon Notch knockdown and could not find any significant difference to controls ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ) . Altogether these results confirm that Notch activation is essential to induce lozenge expression in larval hemocytes that will mature into crystal cells', 'Since we used the HmlΔ-GAL4 driver , we could not distinguish if Serrate is necessary in Hml+Lz− , in Hml+Lz+ , or in both cell types . To test these alternatives , we performed knockdown of Serrate with the Lz-GAL4 driver and found no reduction in the number of crystal cells ( Females in Figure 3D , males in Figure 3—figure supplement 5 )', 'In addition , two other GAL4 drivers expressed in plasmatocytes , Eater-GAL4 and Pxn-GAL4 , reduce the number of sessile crystal cells when driving Serrate RNAi ( females in Figure 3D , males in Figure 3—figure supplement 5 ) . Hence , we conclude that plasmatocyte are responsible for Serrate signaling to activate Notch in other plasmatocytes and start crystal cell development', 'For Notch pathway activation , cells need to be in contact because the ligand Serrate is membrane bound ( Guruharsha et al . , 2012 ) . The fact that Serrate expression in Hml+Lz− hemocytes is necessary for crystal cell development suggests that Lz+ cells are induced when hemocytes are in contact within the clusters', 'If this is the case , we can predict that the probability of an Hml+ cell to be also Lz+ increases with the number of cell contacts it establishes with Hml+Lz− cells . We quantified the number of cell contacts that each cell type makes within the sessile clusters and compared cells within the same size range ( i . e . , limited to the maximum size of Hml+Lz− cells )', 'As predicted , the proportion of Hml+Lz+/ Hml+Lz− increases with the number of Hml+Lz− cells with which it is in contact ( Figure 4A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06166 . 016Figure 4 .

It is possible to detect lymph gland derived hemocytes by flow cytometry with Dot-GAL4 lineage-traced hemocytes in pupa ( blue line ) or when larvae are infected with parasitoid wasps ( green line ) . In contrast , lymph gland-derived hemocytes are virtually absent from L3 larvae in homeostasis ( red line )', 'DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06166 . 019 Given that the clustering of hemocytes is important for hematopoietic decisions , we tested this idea further by assessing how the absence of clusters would affect crystal cell differentiation . A misexpression screen identified some genes that when overexpressed in hemocytes can disrupt hemocyte clusters ( Stofanko et al . , 2008 )', 'However , we did not use these lines to test for crystal cell/plasmatocyte ratio alterations because it would be difficult to discern between the effect of not having the clusters and the effect of gene up-regulation in hemocytes . We opted to disrupt the hemocyte clusters by manipulating physically the larvae ( Makhijani et al . , 2011 )', 'By rolling groups of larvae between two cover slides , it is possible to force the hemocytes to detach from the epidermis and enter hemolymph circulation . After cluster disruption , hemocytes start to aggregate again , gradually ( Makhijani et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 )', 'To maintain hemocytes in circulation for a period of 10 hr , we disrupted hemocyte clusters in larvae every 1 hr 30 min ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ) . Using flow cytometry , we measured the proportion of Hml+Lz+/Hml+Lz− cells at the end of this treatment', 'The relative number of Hml+Lz+ cells decreases in the treatment group ( Figure 4B ) , indicating that clusters are necessary for crystal cell differentiation . However , the cluster disruption treatment could also disrupt the lymph gland and/or change the rate of apoptosis differentially between Hml+Lz+ and Hml+Lz− cells . We tested both possibilities', 'Firstly , using a PI exclusion assay , we determined if the rate of apoptosis changes upon cluster disruption . There is no significant difference between control and treatment groups ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 )', 'Secondly , to check if cluster disruption affects the lymph gland , we made use of DotGAL4 , a driver expressed in lymph gland hemocytes but not in circulating and sessile hemocytes ( Honti et al . , 2010 ) . Through lineage tracing analysis with Dot-GAL4 driver , we can check cells that are derived from the lymph gland', 'Indeed , using flow cytometry , we can observe lymph gland-derived hemocytes in the circulating pool of wasp-infected larvae and pupae ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . When the same technique is used in cluster-disrupted larvae , there is no detectable lymph gland-derived hemocytes in circulation ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 )', 'Thus , the integrity of the cluster is necessary for crystal cell differentiation . Strikingly , in agreement with our observations , recent work shows that in Eater mutants that do not form hemocyte clusters , sessile crystal cells are absent ( Bretscher et al . , 2015 )', 'Altogether these results support that Notch signaling is necessary for crystal cell differentiation and depends on cluster structure . It is important to note , though , that hemocytes form clusters of different sizes and at different locations along the larval body ( Kurucz et al . , 2007; Makhijani et al . , 2011 )', 'Our cluster disruption procedure affects sessile hemocytes indiscriminately such that we cannot determine the relative importance of these cluster features on crystal cell differentiation . \\n Our motivation to carry out this work was to explain the increase of circulating and sessile crystal cell numbers during Drosophila larval development', 'This phenomenon is lined with an apparent paradox: no mature crystal cell has been seen dividing during larval stages ( Rizki , 1957; Lanot et al . , 2001; Krzemien et al . , 2010 ) and crystal cells in the lymph gland do not enter circulation in homeostatic conditions ( Holz et al . , 2003 )', 'Crystal cell number increase may rely upon a population of pro-crystal cells that proliferates in the larva before cell maturation or that that exists in sufficient numbers at the beginning of development to mature into crystal cells throughout development . The first known upregulated gene diagnostic of crystal cell development is the transcription factor lozenge ( Lz ) ( Lebestky et al', ', 2000 ) . That is , a cell will be Lz+ before it matures into crystal cell and maintains this expression upon differentiation ( Lebestky et al . , 2000 ) . We have shown that throughout third instar development , the number of Lz+ cells in the sessile population increases', 'This observation excludes the possibility that a population of Lz+ cells exists in fixed number and matures into crystal cell . Lz+ cells have been reported to proliferate during embryogenesis ( Lebestky et al . , 2000 ) . Surprisingly , we do not see Lz+ cell division in our video analysis', 'Although , with our results , we cannot exclude that a small proportion of Lz+ cells proliferate during larval stages , we can show that lozenge induction in Hml+Lz− is sufficient to explain the increase in Hml+ Lz+ cells during third instar larva . The activation of lozenge in hemocytes is Notch-dependent with Serrate acting as the ligand ( Duvic et al . , 2002; Lebestky et al . , 2003 )', 'When we ablate serrate expression only in hemocytes using the HmlΔ-GAL4 driver coupled to a UAS-SerRNAi , the number of differentiated crystal cells is severely reduced within the sessile population . This indicates that hemocytes are the cells responsible for crystal cell induction in sessile clusters', 'Moreover , the hemocytes inducing crystal cell development are themselves Lz− because SerrateRNAi driven by Lz-GAL4 driver does not decrease the number of crystal cells . For Notch to be activated it requires that a Serrate expressing cell is in contact for a certain period of time ( Guruharsha et al . , 2012 )', 'We show that this contact is a property of the clusters where Hml+Lz+ cells are induced from Hml+Lz− cells . This observation establishes an important parallel between sessile and lymph gland crystal cell development . In both cases , the precursor to a crystal cell is an Hml+Lz− hemocyte ( Mukherjee et al . , 2011 )', 'However , there is a fundamental difference between these two hematopoietic events regarding the cells where lozenge is first expressed . Although hemocytes only activate lozenge expression in the cortical zone of the lymph gland ( Lebestky et al . , 2000 ) , the work of Krzemien et al', 'suggest that in the medullary zone of the lymph gland cells are already committed to become crystal cells at late second instar ( Krzemien et al . , 2010 ) . This suggests that medullary zone cells migrating to the cortical zone can be considered pro-crystal cells', 'In line with this observation , in the lymph gland , no co-localization between plasmatocyte marker P1 and crystal cell marker Lz is ever observed ( Terriente-Felix et al . , 2013; Ferguson & Martinez-agosto 2014 ) . In contrast , our analyses in hemocyte clusters suggest that lozenge induction occurs in mature plasmatocytes . Firstly , they derive from P1 cells', 'Secondly , Lz+GFPlow cells can phagocyte as opposed to Lz+GFPhigh cells , which loose this capacity . Lz+GFPlow cells are , according to our video analysis , the initial stages of crystal cell differentiation as virtually all Lz+GFPlow become Lz+GFPhigh . Throughout time cells increase their GFP expression and become larger', 'Altogether our results suggest that mature plasmatocytes can differentiate into crystal cells . This conclusion may help explaining some disparate results in the literature . Firstly , circulating crystal cells in the larva derive from cells that express the plasmatocyte-specific marker croquemort during the embryonic stage ( Franc et al . , 1999; Honti et al . , 2010 ) . Secondly , Lebestky et al', 'consider that a small fraction of the Lz-GAL4 positive cells gives rise to plasmatocytes defined by morphology and croquemort expression ( Lebestky et al . , 2000 ) . In light of our results , we propose that the plasmatocyte-like cells expressing lozenge are plasmatocytes in route to become crystal cells', 'To our knowledge , the hypothesis that plasmatocytes give rise to crystal cells was put forward by Rizky in 1957 , with the purpose of explaining how crystal cells increase in number without proliferation ( Rizki , 1957 ) . Our work provides the first body of evidence that puts this idea to test and validates this hypothesis', 'It is possible that , contrary to the lymph gland , hemocyte clusters are not regionalized structures ( Honti et al . , 2014 ) . Yet , with the results shown here , we propose that hemocyte clusters work as a true hematopoietic tissue . Their presence and integrity are necessary for the proper establishment of Hml+Lz+/Hml+Lz− numbers during larva development', 'Interestingly , the hemocytes in clusters are in dynamic relation with circulating hemocytes ( Babcock et al . , 2008; Welman et al . , 2010; Makhijani et al . , 2011 ) . This is confirmed in our videos where cells can be observed entering circulation from the patches and leaving circulation to become sessile', 'This dynamics opens the possibility of a more complex number and cell type regulation mechanism operating at the whole-organism level . Secondly , another interesting property of sessile plasmatocytes consists of their higher division rate with respect to their circulating counterparts ( Makhijani et al . , 2011 )', 'This could happen because there is a different molecular ‘environment’ in hemocyte clusters ( Makhijani et al . , 2011 ) and/or because a sessile cell has an increased probability of entering cell division . We argue that the existence of these two characteristics , cell proliferation control and cell differentiation , is sufficient to consider the hemocyte clusters as hematopoietic tissues', 'In brief , hemocyte clusters enhance hemocyte proliferation and provide structure as to guarantee the necessary cell contacts that engage the signaling events behind cell fate decisions . Noticeably , hemocytes in clusters can be mobilized to circulation upon immune challenge ( Zettervall et al . , 2004 ) , a process that is in part dependent on the small GTPase Rac1 ( Xavier and Williams , 2011 )', 'The role of hemocyte clusters is most likely restricted to larval stages because , once pupariation starts , a peak of ecdysone promotes the dispersion of hemocytes throughout the epidermis ( Regan et al . , 2013 ) . The differentiation of crystal cells from plasmatocytes within sessile clusters creates , in our view , an interesting parallel with macrophage development in vertebrates', \"Macrophages are the most plastic cells in the vertebrate's hematopoietic tissue and their specialization in vivo depends on the local microenvironment provided by the tissue they colonize ( Ostuni and Natoli , 2011; Wynm et al . , 2013 )\", 'Similarly , here we show that in Drosophila larvae the microenvironment provided by hemocyte clusters is necessary to induce crystal cell differentiation from plasmatocytes , namely through a cell-contact mechanism involving Notch-Serrate . A putative important difference between hemocyte clusters and the lymph gland concerns the mechanisms in control of cell proliferation and differentiation', 'In support of this notion , misexpression of some genes in hemocytes can disrupt hemocyte clusters without affecting lymph gland morphology ( Stofanko et al . , 2008 ) . Tightly linked to this question is one other fundamental aspect that remains unaddressed: the control of proportions between different cell types', 'Throughout homeostatic development , it is commonly observed , both in vertebrates ( Almeida et al . , 2005 ) and invertebrates ( Rizki , 1957 ) , that blood cell types respect fixed relative numbers . Also , it is now evident that plasmatocytes are very plastic cells and may represent a rare case of functionally mature cells transdifferentiating into other cell types: lamellocytes ( Honti et al', ', 2010 ) and crystal cells . Transdifferentiation , the process where a cell changes its cell fate without passing through a less differentiated state , is used recurrently in cell culture assays but rarely seen in vivo ( Jopling et al . , 2011 ) . How recurrent this mechanism may be in animal development presents itself as one important question for the future', 'We consider that acknowledging this novel hematopoietic organ , dynamically attached to the circulating hemocyte population and relying on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis , brings us a step closer to addressing these outstanding fundamental questions of Drosophila hematopoiesis . \\n All fly stocks were maintained in standard fly food at room temperature', 'Experiments were performed at 25°C except for RNAi experiments that were performed at 29°C .

      "\t ['Spatial and temporal cues are required to specify neuronal diversity , but how these cues are integrated in neural progenitors remains unknown .

In both systems , the neuroectoderm and neural progenitor population acquire regional differences due to the action of Hox genes and spatial patterning genes ( Jessell , 2000 )', 'Although spatial patterning generates diversity within the neural progenitor population , it is insufficient to account for the neuronal diversity in the mature nervous system . Expanding neural diversity requires a second step called temporal patterning , where individual neural progenitors produce a sequence of distinct neurons and glia ( Doe , 2017 )', 'In both Drosophila and mammals , this process appears to be regulated , in part , by temporal transcription factors ( TTFs ) that are sequentially expressed within individual neural progenitors ( Kohwi and Doe , 2013 )', 'Although a great deal is known about how spatial factors generate regional diversity , and much has recently been learned about temporal patterning mechanisms , virtually nothing is known about how spatial factors and TTFs are integrated to specify distinct neuronal identities in spatially distinct progenitor populations', 'Drosophila is an excellent model system to investigate how spatial and temporal factors are integrated during neurogenesis , due to a deep understanding of neural progenitor ( neuroblast ) lineages , and the molecular mechanisms involved in both spatial and temporal patterning during neurogenesis', 'The Drosophila neuroectoderm produces a bilateral array of 30 neuroblasts in each segment , named according to their row and columnar position within the two dimensional neuroblast array ( Figure 1A , left ) . Each neuroblast has a unique identity based on its distinct molecular profile and each neuroblast produces a unique and stereotyped family of neurons', 'Spatial patterning factors that specify neuroblast identity have been characterized , and all of them are transcription factors or signalling pathways with transcription factor effectors . Henceforth we refer to these spatial factors as ‘spatial transcription factors’ or STFs , paralleling the naming of temporal transcription factors as TTFs', 'The Gooseberry ( Gsb ) Pax-3 family transcription factor is expressed in row 5 neuroblasts; loss of Gsb transforms row 5 neuroblasts into row 3/4 identity , and misexpression of Gsb transforms row 3/4 neuroblasts into row 5 identity', 'Importantly , transient misexpression of Gsb in the neuroectoderm , prior to neuroblast formation , is sufficient to generate ectopic row 5 neuroblasts , suggesting that neuroblast identity is determined in the neuroectoderm and maintained during the subsequent neuroblast lineage ( Skeath et al . , 1995; Bhat , 1996 ) . Thus , Gsb is one of the best characterized STFs', 'Similarly , the secreted Wingless ( Wg ) protein is produced by row 5 neuroectoderm , where it is required to specify the adjacent row 4 and 6 neuroblast identity that is maintained in the row 4 and 6 neuroblasts ( Chu-LaGraff and Doe , 1993 )', 'Precise inactivation of a temperature-sensitive Wg protein showed that loss of Wg activity in the neuroectoderm resulted in loss of neuroblast identity , whereas inactivation of Wg after neuroblast formation had no effect , showing that transient Wg generates row 4 and 6 neuroblast identity ( Chu-LaGraff and Doe , 1993 )', 'In addition , Hedgehog ( Hh ) expression in row 6/7 neuroectoderm is required to specify neuroblast identity in adjacent rows 1/2 ( McDonald and Doe , 1997 ) . Finally , Engrailed expression in the neuroectoderm is required for the proper development of row 6/7 neuroblasts , and transient Engrailed misexpression generates ectopic row 7 neuroblast identity ( Deshpande et al . , 2001 )', 'Taken together , these spatial patterning experiments show that neuroblast spatial identity is specified in the neuroectoderm by the transient action of STFs expressed in different neuroblast rows . Spatial patterning does not only generate distinct rows of neuroblasts , but also distinct neuroblast columns', 'During the first stages of neuroblast formation there are three distinct columns of neuroblasts , each specified by a conserved homeodomain protein .

Loss of function and misexpression studies show that each is necessary and partially sufficient for specifying columnar neuroblast identity ( Isshiki et al . , 1997; McDonald et al . , 1998; Weiss et al . , 1998 ) . It is likely that these columnar factors function in the neuroectoderm , like spatial row factors , because they do not persist throughout neuroblast lineages', 'All three of these STFs have conserved mammalian orthologs with similar medial-lateral expression in the neuroectoderm ( Weiss et al . , 1998 ) . Overall , the combination of row and columnar STFs are likely to generate the observed 30 distinct neuroblast identities', 'Hox factors provide an additional spatial cue that distinguishes segmental differences in neuroblast identity ( Prokop and Technau , 1994 ) . Whereas spatial patterning generates 30 different neuroblast identities , temporal patterning is required to generate different progeny within each neuroblast lineage', 'Most neuroblasts sequentially express a series of four TTFs as they divide to generate ganglion mother cell ( GMC ) progeny , and the specific TTF inherited by each GMC determines its identity ( Kohwi and Doe , 2013; Li et al . , 2013; Doe , 2017 )', 'Embryonic ventral nerve cord ( VNC ) neuroblasts undergo a TTF cascade that progresses from Hunchback ( Hb; Ikaros zinc finger family ) to Krüppel ( zinc finger family ) to the redundant Nubbin/Pdm2 ( Pdm ) to Castor ( Cas; Casz1 zinc finger family ) ( Figure 1A , middle )', 'Other neuroblasts in the larval VNC , brain , and optic lobes undergo a similar TTF cascade to increase neuronal diversity , although the identity of the TTFs differs in each region ( Li et al . , 2013; Doe , 2017 )', 'The Hb-Kr-Pdm-Cas TTF cascade has been particularly well-characterized , with each factor being necessary and sufficient to specify the neuronal identity produced during its window of expression ( Isshiki et al . , 2001; Novotny et al . , 2002; Kanai et al . , 2005; Grosskortenhaus et al . , 2006; Tran and Doe , 2008; Kohwi et al . , 2013 )', 'Importantly , each TTF specifies a different type of neuron in each neuroblast lineage , showing that spatial identity provides a different context for Hb function in each neuroblast ( Figure 1A , right ) .

Rather , Hb binding in each neuroblast is likely restricted to a subset of neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains', 'In support of this model , the Gsb STF , required to specify NB5-6 but not NB7-4 , shows enriched occupancy at open chromatin and Hb enriched loci in NB5-6 , but not in NB7-4 , consistent with a role for Gsb in generating neuroblast-specific open chromatin organization', 'Our findings support a sequential specification model in which STFs create neuroblast-specific chromatin organization , leading to neuroblast-specific Hb DNA-binding . \\n Here we characterize two Gal4 lines that label either the NB5-6 or the NB7-4 lineages , which is a prerequisite for profiling neuroblast-specific Hb binding sites', 'NB5-6 forms in the Gsb domain , whereas NB7-4 forms in the Engrailed domain ( Figure 2A ) .

We confirmed that this line labels NB7-4 and its lineage from stage 10 until the end of stage 17 ( Figure 2E–G’; Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) ; the only off-target expression is in the adjacent NB5-6 lineage in 6% of hemisegments ( n\\xa0=\\xa01176 )', 'Henceforth we call this line ‘NB7-4-Gal4 . ’ Both NB5-6-Gal4 and NB7-4-Gal4 lines are first expressed after Hb expression in the NB , but during the ‘Hb competence window’ defined by the presence of Distal antenna ( Dan ) nuclear protein in stage 9–12 neuroblasts ( Figure 2C’ and F’ ) ( Kohwi et al . , 2013 )', 'Importantly , ectopic Hb can induce early-born neuronal identity throughout the Hb competence window , and thus the relevant Hb DNA-binding sites are still accessible . We conclude that NB5-6-Gal4 and NB7-4-Gal4 lines are each expressed in a single neuroblast and its progeny during the Hb competence window and thus are ideal tools for expressing Dam or Dam:Hb in specific neuroblast lineages', 'We next identified the early-born Hb+\\xa0progeny from both lineages , to ensure that each neuroblast lineage makes different Hb+\\xa0progeny . DiI clonal analyses show that both NB5-6 and NB7-4 make distinct populations of interneurons , but also similar populations of subperineurial glia , and their birth-order in the lineage has not been determined ( Schmidt et al . , 1997; Schmid et al . , 1999 )', 'Therefore , we used NB5-6-Gal4 to generate MultiColorFlipOut ( MCFO; Nern et al . , 2015 ) single neuron labelling among NB5-6 progeny', 'We repeatedly ( n\\xa0=\\xa031 ) identified a Hb+ neuron that had a characteristic ipsilateral ascending projection , which we name the Chaise Lounge neuron due to its distinctive morphology; two segmentally repeated Chaise Lounge neurons are shown in Figure 2H; inset shows a Chaise Lounge neuron expressing Hb . We searched the EM reconstruction ( Ohyama et al', ', 2015 ) and identified an identical Chaise Lounge neuron ( Figure 2I ) . Thus , NB5-6 makes a distinctive ipsilateral neuron during its Hb expression window', 'Similarly , we used NB7-4-Gal4 to generate MCFO single cell labelling , but could not directly identify a Hb+\\xa0neuron either due to loss of Hb from early-born neurons prior to neuronal differentiation , or due to lack of Gal4 expression in these neurons', 'Instead , we used multiple criteria to identify a putative early-born neuron , the G neuron , using MARCM clones ( Figure 2J ) , and EM reconstruction ( Figure 2K )', 'Our criteria for assigning this neuron as early-born include ( i ) presence of the neuron in full NB7-4 clones ( Figure 2J ) but not in the NB7-4-Gal4 pattern ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) , which misses early-born neurons; ( ii ) cell body position next to the neuropil , where most Hb+\\xa0neurons are located ( Kambadur et al', ', 1998 ) ; and ( iii ) close morphological match to the grasshopper G neuron , an early-born neuron from NB7-4 , including ascending and descending projections in the most lateral connective tract ( Raper et al . , 1983 ) . Finally , we note that all NB7-4 neuronal progeny have contralateral axons ( Schmidt et al . , 1997; Schmid et al', ', 1999 ) , whereas the NB5-6 early-born Chaise Lounge neuron has ipsilateral projections .

This makes NB5-6 and NB7-4 an appropriate model system to characterize how different spatial patterning cues produce distinct Hb+\\xa0early born cell types', 'The first step in using the TaDa method to map Hb occupancy in the NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages is to generate a functional , non-toxic Dam:Hb fusion protein . Although other Dam constructs have been shown to be non-toxic ( Southall et al . , 2013; Marshall et al . , 2016; Aughey et al . , 2018 ) , this is the first use of Dam:Hb and its toxicity is unknown', 'We used standard methods to generate a UAS-LT3-Dam:hb transgene where the first open reading frame ( ORF ) encodes Cherry and the second ORF encodes Dam:Hb ( see Figure 1D , F ) ; placing the Dam fusion protein in the second ORF is important to keep both Dam and Hb levels extremely low , which reduces toxicity and increases specificity of DNA binding ( Southall et al . , 2013 )', 'To determine if Dam:Hb is toxic , we expressed the fusion protein throughout the nervous system ( sca-Gal4 UAS-Dam:Hb ) and ubiquitously ( Da-Gal4 UAS-Dam:Hb ) , and observed no effect on embryonic viability ( Figure 3A )', 'To determine whether the Hb portion of the Dam:Hb fusion protein was functional , we assayed for its ability to generate ectopic Eve+\\xa0U neurons , despite being expressed at very low levels . In wild type , NB7-1 generates five Eve+\\xa0U neurons , including the Hb+\\xa0early born U1 and U2 neurons , and extending neuroblast expression of Hb produces many ectopic Eve+\\xa0U1/U2 neurons ( Isshiki et al', ', 2001; Pearson and Doe , 2003 ) . We observed that expression of Dam:Hb was capable of inducing a small number of ectopic Eve+\\xa0neurons ( Figure 3B ) , despite the low levels of Dam:Hb , showing that Dam:Hb is functional . We conclude that Dam:Hb is non-toxic in embryos , and that it is functional for inducing early-born neuronal identity', 'The fact that Dam:Hb can induce early-born neuronal identity suggests that it can bind the same genomic targets as Hb , but we wanted to determine this important point experimentally . The TaDa method involves comparing Dam genomic binding to Dam:Hb genomic binding , with a normalised ratio used to identify sites preferentially bound by the Dam:Hb fusion protein ( Southall et al', ', 2013; Marshall and Brand , 2015 ) . We expressed Dam or Dam:Hb in all cells throughout embryogenesis , measured the quantile normalised ratio between them to identify Dam:Hb binding sites ( see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods ) , and performed three biological replicates at embryonic stage 17', 'We found that the biological replicates showed high Pearson correlation coefficients ( Figure 3C , left ) , and were qualitatively very similar along the entire fourth chromosome ( Figure 3C , right ) . Most importantly , we compared Dam:Hb genomic occupancy with published Hb genomic occupancy determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) ( Li et al . , 2008; Bradley et al . , 2010 )', 'A comparison over 700 kb of genomic DNA on chromosome 3R showed qualitatively similar Dam:Hb and Hb ChIP binding profiles ( Figure 3D ) . Indeed , enriched Dam:Hb binding was detected at eight of the nine known Hb target genes ( Lyne et al . , 2007 ) ( Figure 3E , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 )', 'We next compared the similarities in Hb occupancy as reported by these two techniques at the genomic level . To do this , we ran the MACS2 peak caller ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) on the two datasets and identified 6597 and 6656 regions significantly enriched for Dam:Hb and Hb ChIP respectively ( see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods ) . We found that 1972 regions were shared between the two ( 29', '89% of ChIP peaks and 29 . 62% of Dam:Hb peaks ) . When broad peaks were used for this analysis , 2394 regions were shared between the two , or 33 . 74% of ChIP peaks and 45 . 13% of Dam:Hb peaks; and when the narrow peaks were extended to 2 kb on either side of the peak summit , 2207 regions were shared between the two , or 57 . 53% of ChIP peaks and 60 . 37% of Dam:Hb peaks', 'A Monte Carlo analysis on the narrow peak overlap showed this was highly significant , detecting only 6 . 16% overlap with a set of random peaks ( 100 iterations , p-value\\xa0<\\xa01 e−300 , see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods ) . Correspondingly , we found high ChIP signals at the Dam:Hb binding sites and vice versa ( Figure 3F , G , Figure 3—figure supplement 2 )', 'Importantly , this overlap in occupancy was not seen when the Dam:Hb data were compared with the ChIP-seq data of any other transcription factor , such as Ftz or Bcd ( Figure 3G ) , demonstrating the specificity of the method', 'Additional support for the accuracy of Dam:Hb binding is that the known Hb DNA-binding motif is the most enriched motif at Dam:Hb binding sites ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . Taken together , these results show that Dam:Hb binding closely mimics endogenous Hb binding', 'At this point we have validated two neuroblast-specific Gal4 lines , as well as shown that Dam:Hb genomic binding is both reproducible and matches published Hb ChIP data in stage nine whole embryos', 'However , to test the two models of spatial and temporal integration we had to use Dam:Hb in the NB5-6 or NB7-4 lineages – much smaller pools of cells – to determine whether Hb genomic targets were the same or different in these spatially distinct NB lineages', 'Therefore , our next step was to determine if we could get reproducible Dam:Hb binding data from this small pool of cells , and with shorter Dam:Hb exposure than previously reported ( Southall et al . , 2013; Erclik et al . , 2017; Widmer et al . , 2018 ) . For this purpose , we modified the published protocol to allow processing of more starting material ( see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods )', 'We expressed Dam:Hb in a single neuroblast lineage in each hemisegment ( about 200 cells in the\\xa0~50 , 000 cell embryo ) and for five hours ( from embryonic stage 9–12 ) . Previous experiments had expressed Dam constructs in a higher fraction of cells and for\\xa0≥12 hr ( Southall et al . , 2013; Cheetham et al . , 2018; Widmer et al . , 2018 )', 'We expressed Dam:Hb using each of two neuroblast-specific Gal4 lines ( NB5-6-Gal4 and NB7-4-Gal4 ) and purified DNA from stage 12 embryos , near the end of the Hb competence window ( see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods ) . We performed three biological replicates for each neuroblast and observed excellent reproducibility across all replicates ( Figure 4A )', 'We conclude that we can get a reproducible Dam:Hb signal from a single neuroblast lineage during the Hb competence window . Next , we wanted to determine whether Dam:Hb binds the same or different loci in the two different neuroblasts', 'The high correlation between biological replicates for each neuroblast , plus the lack of correlation between the two neuroblasts , provided a gross indication that Dam:Hb has unique binding sites in each neuroblast lineage ( Figure 4A )', 'We expected the number of differentially bound loci to be relatively small , because most genes are not predicted to regulate NB5-6/NB7-4 differences , and indeed , comparing Hb binding along the entire fourth chromosome shows qualitative similarities between the two NB lineages ( Figure 4B )', 'This is also evident at genes known to be expressed in and regulated by Hb across many neuroblast lineages – for\\xa0example Kr , pdm2 and zfh2 ( Isshiki et al . , 2001 ) ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . These similarities confirm the reproducibility of Dam:Hb binding in two distinct neuroblast lineages', 'To begin our analysis of differential Dam:Hb binding between NB5-6 lineage and NB7-4 lineages , we first ran the MACS2 peak caller ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) on the six datasets – three replicates of NB5-6 lineage and three replicates of NB7-4 lineage – to identify regions significantly bound by Hb in each sample', 'The rest of our analyses focussed on the significantly bound Hb loci in the two NB lineages . We used the R Bioconductor package DiffBind ( Ross-Innes et al', ', 2012 ) to identify 4224 differentially bound loci in the two NB lineages: 2007 that were enriched for Dam:Hb binding in the NB5-6 lineage , and 2217 that were enriched for Dam:Hb binding in the NB7-4 lineage ( Figure 4C; Supplementary file 1 ) . In addition , there were 2860 loci occupied by Dam:Hb in both neuroblast lineages ( Supplementary file 1 )', 'Importantly , while the read densities at individual loci are similar between replicates , they are strikingly different between the two neuroblast lineages . Next we represented the differentially bound loci using a volcano plot , where the magenta dots highlight the most significantly differential loci with more than 2-fold change and an FDR of\\xa0≤0 . 01 ( Figure 4D )', 'This threshold corresponds to 718 Hb enriched loci in NB5-6 lineage and 504 Hb enriched loci in NB7-4 lineage ( Supplementary file 1 ) , which is what we use for all subsequent analyses . The genes closest to the top five differentially occupied loci in each neuroblast are marked in this plot , and shown in Figure 4E , F', 'Based on these results , we conclude that Dam:Hb binds different loci in different neuroblasts . This clearly rules out the independent specification model where Hb has identical binding sites in different neuroblasts . We next wanted to understand how STFs might influence TTF genomic binding', 'Given the order of their action – STFs acting early in the neuroectoderm , and TTFs acting later in the delaminated NB – one possibility is that STFs generate different open/closed chromatin landscapes in each neuroblast such that TTFs have access to different loci in each neuroblast . This would predict that spatially distinct NBs would have different open/closed chromatin landscapes', 'To determine if this were indeed true , we performed chromatin accessibility profiling by Dam only ( CaTaDa ) , which exploits the ability of the Dam protein to bind open chromatin domains ( Aughey et al . , 2018 )', 'We first expressed Dam in all cells throughout embryogenesis using Da-Gal4 and observed excellent reproducibility between biological replicates both qualitatively and quantitatively ( Figure 5A , red tracks in C ) . We next wanted to confirm that Dam only binding in the embryo correlates with open chromatin domains , as has been shown in other cell types ( Aughey et al . , 2018 )', 'To do this , we analysed the Dam only signal around the DNase I hypersensitive sites ( peaks ) made available by the BDTNP consortium ( Thomas et al . , 2011 ) and found enriched Dam signals around the DNaseI peaks , as well as qualitative similarities between the two ( Figure 5B , compare red and ochre tracks in C )', 'We observed 6 , 708 Dam only peaks were aligned with DNase I hypersensitive peaks ( 44 . 6% of all Dam only peaks; 33 . 9% of all DNaseI peaks ) . A Monte Carlo analysis showed this was highly significant , detecting only 18 . 14% overlap with a set of random peaks ( 100 iterations , p-value\\xa0<\\xa01 e−300 , see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods )', 'These data suggest that Dam only can be used to detect open chromatin in embryos . We next sought to determine whether Dam only could be used to assay open chromatin in small pools of cells over a short period of time – for\\xa0example in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages at stage 12', 'We performed three biological replicates of Dam only for each neuroblast , and observed excellent reproducibility in all but one replicate , so we used the two best replicates henceforth ( Figure 5D ) . The reproducibility of the method can also be observed in the similar Dam binding patterns seen at representative control genes that are equally expressed in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages ( e . g', 'Kr , pdm2 and zfh2 ) , or along a large stretch of chromosome 4 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Next , we investigated whether there were global differences in chromatin states between the two neuroblast lineages . To do this , we first determined regions of significantly open chromatin in the two neuroblast lineages by running the MACS2 peak caller ( Zhang et al', ', 2008 ) on the four best replicates , which gave us a ‘peakset’ of significantly open chromatin in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages . We used these regions of open chromatin in both NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages to conduct a differential analysis using the DiffBind package ( Ross-Innes et al', ', 2012 ) and identified a total of 8 , 740 Dam only differentially bound loci , including 3656 loci in the NB5-6 lineage and 5084 loci in the NB7-4 lineage . These regions of differential chromatin accessibility have been represented as an ‘MA plot’ with the NB5-6 differential open chromatin loci at the top and the NB7-4 differential open chromatin loci at the bottom ( Figure 5E )', 'We conclude that there are global differences in the open chromatin landscape between the NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages . Chromatin accessibility has been shown to be the strongest determinant of TF occupancy on the genome ( Li et al . , 2008; Kaplan et al . , 2011; Guertin et al . , 2012 )', 'We wanted to determine if Dam:Hb binding was similarly responsive to the state of the chromatin in the NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages . To do this , we took all Dam:Hb-bound loci – both those specific for each neuroblast as well as those shared by both neuroblasts – and queried the state of the chromatin at these loci in each NB lineage', 'We found that Dam:Hb-bound loci in the NB5-6 lineage were enriched for open chromatin in that lineage ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ) , and similarly , Dam:Hb-bound loci in the NB7-4 lineage were enriched for open chromatin in that lineage ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1B )', 'This suggests that Dam:Hb binding is indeed correlated with chromatin accessibility domains in both NB lineages ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1C )', 'If Dam:Hb preferentially occupies regions of open chromatin , we reasoned that the differentially occupied Dam:Hb loci in each NB lineage ( lineage-specific Hb loci ) must be correlated with differentially open chromatin in that neuroblast lineage ( lineage-specific open chromatin )', 'Indeed , NB5-6-specific Dam:Hb bound loci showed a strong enrichment for open chromatin ( Figure 6A , blue lines ) ; strikingly , these same loci had closed chromatin in NB7-4 ( Figure 6A , green lines )', 'Similarly , NB7-4-specific Dam:Hb bound loci showed strong enrichment for open chromatin ( Figure 6B , green lines ) , while these same loci had closed chromatin in NB5-6 lineage ( Figure 6B , blue lines ) . Corresponding to this , we found 364 peaks , or 50 . 76% of the differential Dam:Hb peaks in NB5-6 overlapped with differentially open chromatin peaks in that lineage; and 164 peaks or 32', '74% of the differential Dam:Hb peaks in NB7-4 overlapped with differentially open chromatin peaks in that lineage . A Monte Carlo analysis showed these overlaps to be highly significant , detecting 5 . 23% overlap with a set of random peaks in NB5-6% and 6 . 75% in NB 7–4 ( 100 iterations , p-value\\xa0<\\xa01 e−300 for NB 5–6 and 8 . 9 e−133 for NB 7–4 , see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods )', 'As a control , we assayed loci bound by Dam:Hb in both neuroblast lineages and found that there was no difference between lineages in open chromatin at these sites ( Figure 6C ) . We confirmed these findings at the top five differentially bound Dam:Hb loci in the two neuroblast lineages', 'All but two of these differentially bound loci were also identified in the differential chromatin analysis; even the two that were not picked up in the analysis ( sqz and mspo ) were qualitatively different between the two neuroblast lineages ( Figure 6D , E ) . We conclude that neuroblast-specific Dam:Hb binding occurs within neuroblast-specific accessible chromatin domains', 'This correlation suggests that either Hb binds where chromatin is open , or that Hb binding opens chromatin . The latter model seems unlikely , because both NB5-6 and NB7-4 are exposed to Hb expression , yet each neuroblast has specific open chromatin domains ( see Discussion )', 'We favor a model in which STFs generate neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains , leading to neuroblast-specific Hb occupancy . If spatial factors generate lineage-specific chromatin landscapes as the sequential specification model proposes , then it’s likely that lineage-specific STF occupancy will correspond to lineage specific chromatin accessibility', 'Gsb is one of the best studied STFs in the embryonic VNC . It has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient to determine the identity of the row 5 NBs ( Skeath et al . , 1995; Bhat , 1996 ) . Not only is Gsb a functionally validated STF , but Gsb ChIP-chip data from 0 to 12 hr embryos are publicly available ( Bonneaud et al . , 2017 )', 'As NB5-6 is a row 5 NB lineage specified by Gsb , it gave us the opportunity to test the sequential specification model more deeply . We asked whether Gsb occupancy was enriched at regions of accessible chromatin in the NB5-6 lineage . We plotted the Gsb ChIP-chip signal around all NB5-6 open chromatin loci and compared this with Gsb ChIP-chip signal around NB7-4 open chromatin loci', 'Indeed , we found an enrichment of Gsb signal specifically around NB5-6 open chromatin and not NB7-4 open chromatin ( Figure 7A ) . A Monte Carlo analysis found this enrichment to be highly significant ( average real NB5−6/NB7-4 fold change\\xa0=\\xa02 . 198 , average simulated NB5−6/NB7-4 fold change\\xa0=\\xa00 . 922 , 100 random iterations , p-value\\xa0=\\xa01 . 19119 e−62 )', 'This supports the hypothesis that lineage-specific STFs generate lineage-specific chromatin landscapes . Finally , we reasoned that if Hb preferentially binds to regions of accessible chromatin , and STF occupancy correlates with open chromatin in a lineage-specific manner , then the lineage-specific Hb occupancy that we observe in NB5-6 should correlate with lineage specific STF occupancy', 'We therefore plotted Gsb signal around NB5-6-enriched Hb loci and found a corresponding enrichment of Gsb occupancy at these regions ( Figure 7B , blue line ) . In contrast , the NB7-4-enriched Hb loci did not show any such enrichment ( Figure 7B , green line ) . A Monte Carlo analysis found this enrichment to be highly significant ( average real NB5-6/NB7-4 fold change\\xa0=\\xa02', '2 , average simulated NB5-6/NB7-4 fold change\\xa0=\\xa01 . 2 , 1000 random iterations , p-value\\xa0=\\xa06 . 54 e−10; see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods ) . Figure 7C represents this analysis graphically: the real signal difference between NB5-6 and NB7-4 ( Figure 7C , red line ) is much greater than the distribution of differences calculated over the 1000 random iterations ( Figure 7C , black line )', 'Furthermore , we found that of the 503 Hb enriched loci in NB5-6 , 101 had a Gsb peak within 2 Kb of the centre , whereas this number was 49 for NB7-4 . A Fisher’s exact test on these data found this spatial relationship to be highly significant for NB5-6 ( p\\xa0=\\xa08 . 78e-19 ) , but not for NB7-4 ( p\\xa0=\\xa00 . 078 )', 'We conclude that loci differentially bound by Hb in NB5-6 are enriched for Gsb occupancy , although we note that occupancy may occur at different times ( Gsb earlier , Hb later ) . Taken together , these data support the sequential specification model , where a transiently expressed STF ( e . g . Gsb ) sculpts a lineage-specific chromatin landscape in NB lineages ( eg', 'NB5-6 ) , this determines lineage-specific binding of TTFs ( e . g . Hb ) , which can in turn specify different neural fates in different NB lineages ( Figure 8 ) . \\n Since its first report , Targeted DamID has been used in multiple cell types , in both Drosophila and mammalian embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) , for mapping transcription factor binding ( Cheetham et al . , 2018; Tosti et al', ', 2018 ) , open chromatin domains ( Aughey et al . , 2018 ) , chromatin states ( Bonneaud et al . , 2017 ) , and for mapping paused or transcribed loci ( Southall et al . , 2013; Widmer et al . , 2018 ) . In all cases , the number of cells expressing the Dam constructs are relatively large:~10 , 000 FACS purified ESCs ( Cheetham et al', ', 2018 ) and\\xa0~5000 mushroom body neurons per brain ( Widmer et al . , 2018 ) . In our study we analyze the smallest percentage of cells to date - we calculate that there are between 8–12 cells in each hemisegment expressing Dam constructs; with a total of 11 segments that would give a maximum of 264 cells per embryo , or about 0 . 5% of the estimated 50 , 000 cells per embryo', 'Furthermore , we pushed the limits of the technique by allowing just 5 hr of Dam or Dam:Hb expression . It’s likely that this restrictive condition was successful in the case of a transcription factor-DNA interaction , which is stable during the time window; it might not be sufficient for factors such as RNA Pol II that require processivity through a gene', 'The ability to query transcription factor occupancy in such a precise manner – in a small subsets of cells over short periods of time – will encourage new uses of the method , such as studying the determination of cellular identities during development , upon reprogramming , or even in response to stimuli', 'We propose that the spatial factor Gsb opens genomic loci in NB5-6 , allowing the temporal factor Hb to bind loci that are not available in the adjacent Gsb-negative NB7-4', 'Although nothing is currently known about the role of Gsb in chromatin regulation , the closely related mammalian Pax3 and Pax7 transcription factors can recruit histone methyltransferase to promote open chromatin and increase gene expression ( McKinnell et al . , 2008; Diao et al . , 2012; Kawabe et al . , 2012 )', 'Moreover , Pax7 is a pioneer factor during pituitary development , opening\\xa0~2500 loci ( Budry et al . , 2012 ) . It would be informative to test whether Gsb can recruit trithorax complex methyltransferase to open genomic loci in row five neuroblasts , and whether this is required for row five neuroblast spatial identity and differential binding of Hb', 'The specific enrichment of Gsb occupancy at regions of accessible chromatin in NB5-6 is a striking result that supports our model despite different cell populations used for each experiment ( total embryonic vs . single NB lineage ) , different stages assayed ( 0–12 vs . 9–12 ) , and different methods used ( Dam vs . Gsb ChIP )', 'Despite these differences , we observed significant enrichment of Gsb-bound loci at open chromatin in a NB-specific manner: NB5-6 shows enrichment , whereas NB7-4 does not', 'Ideally , similar experiments need to be conducted with Dam:Gsb in NB5-6 and Dam:En in NB7-4 lineage to determine correspondence of STF occupancy and chromatin accessibility , as well as STF and TTF occupancy in the NB lineages . The advantage of the Drosophila model is that these relationships can be rigorously tested', 'For example , mutational inactivation of the relevant STF , while assaying chromatin accessibility or Hb occupancy in a lineage-specific way could reveal a causal link between the STF and chromatin landscape , and STF and Hb occupancy . Similarly , targeting chromatin modifiers to select loci while assaying Hb occupancy could demonstrate a causal link between chromatin state and Hb occupancy', 'To definitively rule out the possibility that Hb acts as a pioneer in these lineages , it may be feasible to misexpress or mutate Hb , to determine the effect on chromatin accessibility . These are technically difficult studies , beyond the scope of this paper . We show that\\xa0~1200 Hb-bound loci are different in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages , and that the chromatin at these sites is preferentially open', 'In some cases Dam:Hb occupancy is broader than Dam ( open chromatin ) occupancy; this could be due to Dam:Hb maintaining occupancy longer than Dam alone . The strong correlation between Dam:Hb binding and open chromatin could be due to Hb binding to previously opened chromatin domains , or Hb acting as a pioneer factor to open chromatin', 'We do not favor the latter mechanism because Hb binds some sites in NB5-6 but not in NB7-4 ( and vice versa ) showing that it is not sufficient to open chromatin . NB5-6 and NB7-4 develop adjacent to each other during neuroblast formation . They share a common lateral Msh+\\xa0spatial column , but are in different anterior/posterior spatial domains ( NB5-6 is Gsb+ , NB7-4 is En+ )', 'Although NB5-6 and NB7-4 make different early-born neurons , they share a common ability to make subperineurial glia and neurons that project through the posterior commissure ( Schmidt et al . , 1997; Schmid et al . , 1999 )', 'It is interesting to speculate that their common properties are due to their shared columnar spatial position , whereas their differences are due to different anterior/posterior spatial cues', 'Although we have provided evidence that Hb-bound loci are chosen from neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains , this does not rule out that sequential specification occurs via lineage-specific STFs/STF-target genes acting as Hb cofactors to bias Hb binding in each lineage', 'However , we have been unable to find any de novo DNA motif enriched within 1 kb of Hb-bound loci throughout the genome , either neuroblast-specific loci or within all Hb-bound loci . This is consistent with Hb acting independently , but we can’t rule out the possibility of Hb acting with co-factors', 'Our conclusions are in agreement with studies showing that DNA accessibility , not cooperative or competitive interactions , have the strongest impact on transcription factor binding ( Li et al . , 2008; Kaplan et al . , 2011 ) . Similarly , this model is supported by in vitro protein-DNA studies that eliminate chromatin state contribution to these interactions ( Guertin et al . , 2012 )', 'Using traditional methods of studying protein-DNA interactions , Hb targets in early embryogenesis have been well-characterized ( Hoch et al . , 1991; Struhl et al . , 1992; Rivera-Pomar et al . , 1995; Berman et al . , 2002 ) , yet little is known about Hb direct targets in the CNS , and nothing is known about neuroblast lineage-specific targets that specify lineage-specific neuronal identity', 'Here we’ve reported the first description of Hb occupancy in vivo within the genome of individual neuroblast lineages . Our study identified many loci that were similarly occupied in the two lineages , which are likely to consist of regulatory modules common to both lineages such as pan-neuronal specification or the progression of the temporal series', 'The latter example consists of Hb activating Kr and repressing pdm2 in most neuroblast lineages . Indeed we find that Hb binds to both loci in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages , confirming previous observations that Hb directly represses pdm2 and activates Kr in multiple neuroblast lineages ( Kambadur et al . , 1998; Tran et al . , 2010 )', 'Hb is also likely to directly repress zfh2 in most neuroblast lineages ( CQD , unpublished results ) and our data show that the zfh2 locus is indeed equivalently occupied in both neuroblast lineages . Apart from the commonly regulated loci , we identified over 100 loci that are differentially bound by Hb in NB5-6 or NB7-4 . These are excellent candidates for lineage-specific neuronal specification', 'Our study , coming almost two decades after the first descriptions of spatial and temporal patterning in Drosophila neural stem cells ( Isshiki et al . , 2001 ) , has for the first time explored the mechanism by which spatial and temporal factors could be integrated to generate neuroblast-specific neuronal progeny', 'Only recently has it been possible to probe TTF DNA-binding and chromatin landscapes within two distinct neuroblast lineages – due to the parallel advances in genetic tools , functional genomics , and our ability to manipulate the genome', 'Given the conservation of mechanisms in generating neural diversity in vertebrates and invertebrates , and exquisite ways in which the genome can now be manipulated in different organisms , it is now possible to determine if similar mechanisms generate diversity during vertebrate neurogenesis', 'Fly stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center ( Bloomington , IN USA ) and , unless otherwise stated , were grown on cornmeal media at 25°C .

In both systems , the neuroectoderm and neural progenitor population acquire regional differences due to the action of Hox genes and spatial patterning genes ( Jessell , 2000 )', 'Although spatial patterning generates diversity within the neural progenitor population , it is insufficient to account for the neuronal diversity in the mature nervous system . Expanding neural diversity requires a second step called temporal patterning , where individual neural progenitors produce a sequence of distinct neurons and glia ( Doe , 2017 )', 'In both Drosophila and mammals , this process appears to be regulated , in part , by temporal transcription factors ( TTFs ) that are sequentially expressed within individual neural progenitors ( Kohwi and Doe , 2013 )', 'Although a great deal is known about how spatial factors generate regional diversity , and much has recently been learned about temporal patterning mechanisms , virtually nothing is known about how spatial factors and TTFs are integrated to specify distinct neuronal identities in spatially distinct progenitor populations', 'Drosophila is an excellent model system to investigate how spatial and temporal factors are integrated during neurogenesis , due to a deep understanding of neural progenitor ( neuroblast ) lineages , and the molecular mechanisms involved in both spatial and temporal patterning during neurogenesis', 'The Drosophila neuroectoderm produces a bilateral array of 30 neuroblasts in each segment , named according to their row and columnar position within the two dimensional neuroblast array ( Figure 1A , left ) . Each neuroblast has a unique identity based on its distinct molecular profile and each neuroblast produces a unique and stereotyped family of neurons', 'Spatial patterning factors that specify neuroblast identity have been characterized , and all of them are transcription factors or signalling pathways with transcription factor effectors . Henceforth we refer to these spatial factors as ‘spatial transcription factors’ or STFs , paralleling the naming of temporal transcription factors as TTFs', 'The Gooseberry ( Gsb ) Pax-3 family transcription factor is expressed in row 5 neuroblasts; loss of Gsb transforms row 5 neuroblasts into row 3/4 identity , and misexpression of Gsb transforms row 3/4 neuroblasts into row 5 identity', 'Importantly , transient misexpression of Gsb in the neuroectoderm , prior to neuroblast formation , is sufficient to generate ectopic row 5 neuroblasts , suggesting that neuroblast identity is determined in the neuroectoderm and maintained during the subsequent neuroblast lineage ( Skeath et al . , 1995; Bhat , 1996 ) . Thus , Gsb is one of the best characterized STFs', 'Similarly , the secreted Wingless ( Wg ) protein is produced by row 5 neuroectoderm , where it is required to specify the adjacent row 4 and 6 neuroblast identity that is maintained in the row 4 and 6 neuroblasts ( Chu-LaGraff and Doe , 1993 )', 'Precise inactivation of a temperature-sensitive Wg protein showed that loss of Wg activity in the neuroectoderm resulted in loss of neuroblast identity , whereas inactivation of Wg after neuroblast formation had no effect , showing that transient Wg generates row 4 and 6 neuroblast identity ( Chu-LaGraff and Doe , 1993 )', 'In addition , Hedgehog ( Hh ) expression in row 6/7 neuroectoderm is required to specify neuroblast identity in adjacent rows 1/2 ( McDonald and Doe , 1997 ) . Finally , Engrailed expression in the neuroectoderm is required for the proper development of row 6/7 neuroblasts , and transient Engrailed misexpression generates ectopic row 7 neuroblast identity ( Deshpande et al . , 2001 )', 'Taken together , these spatial patterning experiments show that neuroblast spatial identity is specified in the neuroectoderm by the transient action of STFs expressed in different neuroblast rows . Spatial patterning does not only generate distinct rows of neuroblasts , but also distinct neuroblast columns', 'During the first stages of neuroblast formation there are three distinct columns of neuroblasts , each specified by a conserved homeodomain protein . Vnd is expressed in a medial column of neuroectoderm , Ind is expressed in an intermediate column , and Msh ( Flybase: Drop ) is expressed in the lateral column ( Figure 1A , left ) ( Isshiki et al . , 1997; McDonald et al . , 1998; Weiss et al', ', 1998 ) . Loss of function and misexpression studies show that each is necessary and partially sufficient for specifying columnar neuroblast identity ( Isshiki et al . , 1997; McDonald et al . , 1998; Weiss et al . , 1998 ) . It is likely that these columnar factors function in the neuroectoderm , like spatial row factors , because they do not persist throughout neuroblast lineages', 'All three of these STFs have conserved mammalian orthologs with similar medial-lateral expression in the neuroectoderm ( Weiss et al . , 1998 ) . Overall , the combination of row and columnar STFs are likely to generate the observed 30 distinct neuroblast identities', 'Hox factors provide an additional spatial cue that distinguishes segmental differences in neuroblast identity ( Prokop and Technau , 1994 ) . Whereas spatial patterning generates 30 different neuroblast identities , temporal patterning is required to generate different progeny within each neuroblast lineage', 'Most neuroblasts sequentially express a series of four TTFs as they divide to generate ganglion mother cell ( GMC ) progeny , and the specific TTF inherited by each GMC determines its identity ( Kohwi and Doe , 2013; Li et al . , 2013; Doe , 2017 )', 'Embryonic ventral nerve cord ( VNC ) neuroblasts undergo a TTF cascade that progresses from Hunchback ( Hb; Ikaros zinc finger family ) to Krüppel ( zinc finger family ) to the redundant Nubbin/Pdm2 ( Pdm ) to Castor ( Cas; Casz1 zinc finger family ) ( Figure 1A , middle )', 'Other neuroblasts in the larval VNC , brain , and optic lobes undergo a similar TTF cascade to increase neuronal diversity , although the identity of the TTFs differs in each region ( Li et al . , 2013; Doe , 2017 )', 'The Hb-Kr-Pdm-Cas TTF cascade has been particularly well-characterized , with each factor being necessary and sufficient to specify the neuronal identity produced during its window of expression ( Isshiki et al . , 2001; Novotny et al . , 2002; Kanai et al . , 2005; Grosskortenhaus et al . , 2006; Tran and Doe , 2008; Kohwi et al . , 2013 )', 'Importantly , each TTF specifies a different type of neuron in each neuroblast lineage , showing that spatial identity provides a different context for Hb function in each neuroblast ( Figure 1A , right ) . Understanding this ‘context’ at a mechanistic level is the goal of our experiments below . The role of TTFs is best exemplified by Hb , the first TTF in the cascade', 'Loss of Hb results in absence of the first-born neuron identities in all neuroblast lineages assayed to date ( 1-1 , 3-1 , 3-5 , 7-1 , 7-3 ) . Conversely , driving prolonged Hb expression in neuroblasts results in ectopic first-born neurons in all lineages tested ( Isshiki et al . , 2001; Novotny et al . , 2002; Kanai et al . , 2005; Kohwi et al . , 2013 )', 'For example , prolonged expression of Hb in NB7-1 produces ectopic U1 motor neurons , whereas prolonged expression of Hb in NB7-3 produces ectopic EW1 serotonergic interneurons .

Yet in no case , mammals or Drosophila , is it known how spatial and TTFs are integrated', 'Here we hypothesise two mechanisms by which this integration could occur . ( 1 ) Independent specification ( Figure 1B ) . In this scenario , spatial and temporal transcription factors bind their genomic targets independently , and the combinatorial actions of these factors and their downstream gene regulatory networks results in unique gene expression and therefore unique neural identities', '( 2 ) Sequential specification ( Figure 1C ) . In this scenario , early expression of STFs in the neuroectoderm ( where they are known to act ) biases the subsequent DNA-binding profile of the later expressed TTFs', 'This could happen via STFs generating different chromatin landscapes in each neuroblast , or via STFs promoting the persistent expression of TTF cofactors that result in neuroblast-specific TTF DNA-binding', 'While both scenarios would result in the specification of distinct neural identities in spatially distinct NBs , in the independent specification model , TTF binding will be identical in all neuroblasts whereas in the sequential specification model , TTF binding will occur at different loci in each neuroblast', 'To discriminate between these models , we sought to determine Hb genomic targets in NB5-6 versus NB7-4 . If independent specification is used , we expect to find similar Hb occupancy in each neuroblast ( Figure 1B ) , whereas if sequential specification is used , we expect to find different Hb genomic binding in each neuroblast ( Figure 1C )', 'Our goal was to identify Hb occupancy within the early NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages during the Hb competence window , when Hb retains the ability to generate ectopic early-born neuronal identities , and thus presumably can still bind its normal genomic targets', 'To identify Hb occupancy in these two neuroblast lineages , we adapted the previously described Targeted\\xa0DamID ( TaDa ) method ( Southall et al . , 2013; Marshall et al . , 2016 ) . TaDa relies on an attenuated expression of the DNA adenosine methyltransferase ( Dam ) enzyme ( Figure 1D ) , which binds genomic DNA and methylates adenosine at GATC sites', 'This covalent DNA mark can be used to determine Dam binding sites , due to the very low level of endogenous DNA methylation in Drosophila . Expression of Dam alone can be used to detect open chromatin ( Aughey et al . , 2018 ) ( Figure 1E ) or Dam can be fused to a transcription factor such as Hb , which provides a read-out of Hb genomic occupancy ( Figure 1F )', 'Here we characterize two Gal4 lines that are specific for NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages in the embryo . We use these lines to obtain NB-specific expression of Dam:Hb ( to identify Hb genomic occupancy ) and Dam alone ( to detect open chromatin ) . We demonstrate that Hb has differential targets in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages , which correspond to differentially open chromatin in each lineage', 'Importantly , our observation that Hb-bound loci specific to NB5-6 have open chromatin , but the same loci in NB7-4 have closed chromatin , shows that Hb is not sufficient to create open chromatin . Rather , Hb binding in each neuroblast is likely restricted to a subset of neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains', 'In support of this model , the Gsb STF , required to specify NB5-6 but not NB7-4 , shows enriched occupancy at open chromatin and Hb enriched loci in NB5-6 , but not in NB7-4 , consistent with a role for Gsb in generating neuroblast-specific open chromatin organization', 'Our findings support a sequential specification model in which STFs create neuroblast-specific chromatin organization , leading to neuroblast-specific Hb DNA-binding . \\n Here we characterize two Gal4 lines that label either the NB5-6 or the NB7-4 lineages , which is a prerequisite for profiling neuroblast-specific Hb binding sites', 'NB5-6 forms in the Gsb domain , whereas NB7-4 forms in the Engrailed domain ( Figure 2A ) . To label NB5-6 and its lineage we used ladybird early ( lbe ) -Gal4 , which is reported to specifically label NB5-6 and its progeny ( Urbach and Technau , 2003; Baumgardt et al . , 2009 )', 'We confirmed that lbe-Gal4 expression was highly specific to the NB5-6 and its lineage from stage 10 through stage 12 , the time frame of our experiments ( Figure 2B–D’; Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) , although by stage 17 it has expression in the non-neuronal salivary gland ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . Henceforth we call this line ‘NB5-6-Gal4', '’ To label NB7-4 and its lineage , we used the previously described R19B03AD R18F07DBD split-Gal4 line ( Lacin and Truman , 2016 ) . We confirmed that this line labels NB7-4 and its lineage from stage 10 until the end of stage 17 ( Figure 2E–G’; Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) ; the only off-target expression is in the adjacent NB5-6 lineage in 6% of hemisegments ( n\\xa0=\\xa01176 )', 'Henceforth we call this line ‘NB7-4-Gal4 . ’ Both NB5-6-Gal4 and NB7-4-Gal4 lines are first expressed after Hb expression in the NB , but during the ‘Hb competence window’ defined by the presence of Distal antenna ( Dan ) nuclear protein in stage 9–12 neuroblasts ( Figure 2C’ and F’ ) ( Kohwi et al . , 2013 )', 'Importantly , ectopic Hb can induce early-born neuronal identity throughout the Hb competence window , and thus the relevant Hb DNA-binding sites are still accessible . We conclude that NB5-6-Gal4 and NB7-4-Gal4 lines are each expressed in a single neuroblast and its progeny during the Hb competence window and thus are ideal tools for expressing Dam or Dam:Hb in specific neuroblast lineages', 'We next identified the early-born Hb+\\xa0progeny from both lineages , to ensure that each neuroblast lineage makes different Hb+\\xa0progeny . DiI clonal analyses show that both NB5-6 and NB7-4 make distinct populations of interneurons , but also similar populations of subperineurial glia , and their birth-order in the lineage has not been determined ( Schmidt et al . , 1997; Schmid et al . , 1999 )', 'Therefore , we used NB5-6-Gal4 to generate MultiColorFlipOut ( MCFO; Nern et al . , 2015 ) single neuron labelling among NB5-6 progeny', 'We repeatedly ( n\\xa0=\\xa031 ) identified a Hb+ neuron that had a characteristic ipsilateral ascending projection , which we name the Chaise Lounge neuron due to its distinctive morphology; two segmentally repeated Chaise Lounge neurons are shown in Figure 2H; inset shows a Chaise Lounge neuron expressing Hb . We searched the EM reconstruction ( Ohyama et al', ', 2015 ) and identified an identical Chaise Lounge neuron ( Figure 2I ) . Thus , NB5-6 makes a distinctive ipsilateral neuron during its Hb expression window', 'Similarly , we used NB7-4-Gal4 to generate MCFO single cell labelling , but could not directly identify a Hb+\\xa0neuron either due to loss of Hb from early-born neurons prior to neuronal differentiation , or due to lack of Gal4 expression in these neurons', 'Instead , we used multiple criteria to identify a putative early-born neuron , the G neuron , using MARCM clones ( Figure 2J ) , and EM reconstruction ( Figure 2K )', 'Our criteria for assigning this neuron as early-born include ( i ) presence of the neuron in full NB7-4 clones ( Figure 2J ) but not in the NB7-4-Gal4 pattern ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) , which misses early-born neurons; ( ii ) cell body position next to the neuropil , where most Hb+\\xa0neurons are located ( Kambadur et al', ', 1998 ) ; and ( iii ) close morphological match to the grasshopper G neuron , an early-born neuron from NB7-4 , including ascending and descending projections in the most lateral connective tract ( Raper et al . , 1983 ) . Finally , we note that all NB7-4 neuronal progeny have contralateral axons ( Schmidt et al . , 1997; Schmid et al', ', 1999 ) , whereas the NB5-6 early-born Chaise Lounge neuron has ipsilateral projections . Thus , we conclude that NB5-6 and NB7-4 produce different neurons during the Hb expression window . This makes NB5-6 and NB7-4 an appropriate model system to characterize how different spatial patterning cues produce distinct Hb+\\xa0early born cell types', 'The first step in using the TaDa method to map Hb occupancy in the NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages is to generate a functional , non-toxic Dam:Hb fusion protein . Although other Dam constructs have been shown to be non-toxic ( Southall et al . , 2013; Marshall et al . , 2016; Aughey et al . , 2018 ) , this is the first use of Dam:Hb and its toxicity is unknown', 'We used standard methods to generate a UAS-LT3-Dam:hb transgene where the first open reading frame ( ORF ) encodes Cherry and the second ORF encodes Dam:Hb ( see Figure 1D , F ) ; placing the Dam fusion protein in the second ORF is important to keep both Dam and Hb levels extremely low , which reduces toxicity and increases specificity of DNA binding ( Southall et al . , 2013 )', 'To determine if Dam:Hb is toxic , we expressed the fusion protein throughout the nervous system ( sca-Gal4 UAS-Dam:Hb ) and ubiquitously ( Da-Gal4 UAS-Dam:Hb ) , and observed no effect on embryonic viability ( Figure 3A )', 'To determine whether the Hb portion of the Dam:Hb fusion protein was functional , we assayed for its ability to generate ectopic Eve+\\xa0U neurons , despite being expressed at very low levels . In wild type , NB7-1 generates five Eve+\\xa0U neurons , including the Hb+\\xa0early born U1 and U2 neurons , and extending neuroblast expression of Hb produces many ectopic Eve+\\xa0U1/U2 neurons ( Isshiki et al', ', 2001; Pearson and Doe , 2003 ) . We observed that expression of Dam:Hb was capable of inducing a small number of ectopic Eve+\\xa0neurons ( Figure 3B ) , despite the low levels of Dam:Hb , showing that Dam:Hb is functional . We conclude that Dam:Hb is non-toxic in embryos , and that it is functional for inducing early-born neuronal identity', 'The fact that Dam:Hb can induce early-born neuronal identity suggests that it can bind the same genomic targets as Hb , but we wanted to determine this important point experimentally . The TaDa method involves comparing Dam genomic binding to Dam:Hb genomic binding , with a normalised ratio used to identify sites preferentially bound by the Dam:Hb fusion protein ( Southall et al', ', 2013; Marshall and Brand , 2015 ) . We expressed Dam or Dam:Hb in all cells throughout embryogenesis , measured the quantile normalised ratio between them to identify Dam:Hb binding sites ( see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods ) , and performed three biological replicates at embryonic stage 17', 'We found that the biological replicates showed high Pearson correlation coefficients ( Figure 3C , left ) , and were qualitatively very similar along the entire fourth chromosome ( Figure 3C , right ) . Most importantly , we compared Dam:Hb genomic occupancy with published Hb genomic occupancy determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) ( Li et al . , 2008; Bradley et al . , 2010 )', 'A comparison over 700 kb of genomic DNA on chromosome 3R showed qualitatively similar Dam:Hb and Hb ChIP binding profiles ( Figure 3D ) . Indeed , enriched Dam:Hb binding was detected at eight of the nine known Hb target genes ( Lyne et al . , 2007 ) ( Figure 3E , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 )', 'We next compared the similarities in Hb occupancy as reported by these two techniques at the genomic level . To do this , we ran the MACS2 peak caller ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) on the two datasets and identified 6597 and 6656 regions significantly enriched for Dam:Hb and Hb ChIP respectively ( see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods ) . We found that 1972 regions were shared between the two ( 29', '89% of ChIP peaks and 29 . 62% of Dam:Hb peaks ) . When broad peaks were used for this analysis , 2394 regions were shared between the two , or 33 . 74% of ChIP peaks and 45 . 13% of Dam:Hb peaks; and when the narrow peaks were extended to 2 kb on either side of the peak summit , 2207 regions were shared between the two , or 57 . 53% of ChIP peaks and 60 . 37% of Dam:Hb peaks', 'A Monte Carlo analysis on the narrow peak overlap showed this was highly significant , detecting only 6 . 16% overlap with a set of random peaks ( 100 iterations , p-value\\xa0<\\xa01 e−300 , see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods ) . Correspondingly , we found high ChIP signals at the Dam:Hb binding sites and vice versa ( Figure 3F , G , Figure 3—figure supplement 2 )', 'Importantly , this overlap in occupancy was not seen when the Dam:Hb data were compared with the ChIP-seq data of any other transcription factor , such as Ftz or Bcd ( Figure 3G ) , demonstrating the specificity of the method', 'Additional support for the accuracy of Dam:Hb binding is that the known Hb DNA-binding motif is the most enriched motif at Dam:Hb binding sites ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . Taken together , these results show that Dam:Hb binding closely mimics endogenous Hb binding', 'At this point we have validated two neuroblast-specific Gal4 lines , as well as shown that Dam:Hb genomic binding is both reproducible and matches published Hb ChIP data in stage nine whole embryos', 'However , to test the two models of spatial and temporal integration we had to use Dam:Hb in the NB5-6 or NB7-4 lineages – much smaller pools of cells – to determine whether Hb genomic targets were the same or different in these spatially distinct NB lineages', 'Therefore , our next step was to determine if we could get reproducible Dam:Hb binding data from this small pool of cells , and with shorter Dam:Hb exposure than previously reported ( Southall et al . , 2013; Erclik et al . , 2017; Widmer et al . , 2018 ) . For this purpose , we modified the published protocol to allow processing of more starting material ( see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods )', 'We expressed Dam:Hb in a single neuroblast lineage in each hemisegment ( about 200 cells in the\\xa0~50 , 000 cell embryo ) and for five hours ( from embryonic stage 9–12 ) .

We performed three biological replicates for each neuroblast and observed excellent reproducibility across all replicates ( Figure 4A )', 'We conclude that we can get a reproducible Dam:Hb signal from a single neuroblast lineage during the Hb competence window . Next , we wanted to determine whether Dam:Hb binds the same or different loci in the two different neuroblasts', 'The high correlation between biological replicates for each neuroblast , plus the lack of correlation between the two neuroblasts , provided a gross indication that Dam:Hb has unique binding sites in each neuroblast lineage ( Figure 4A )', 'We expected the number of differentially bound loci to be relatively small , because most genes are not predicted to regulate NB5-6/NB7-4 differences , and indeed , comparing Hb binding along the entire fourth chromosome shows qualitative similarities between the two NB lineages ( Figure 4B )', 'This is also evident at genes known to be expressed in and regulated by Hb across many neuroblast lineages – for\\xa0example Kr , pdm2 and zfh2 ( Isshiki et al . , 2001 ) ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . These similarities confirm the reproducibility of Dam:Hb binding in two distinct neuroblast lineages', 'To begin our analysis of differential Dam:Hb binding between NB5-6 lineage and NB7-4 lineages , we first ran the MACS2 peak caller ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) on the six datasets – three replicates of NB5-6 lineage and three replicates of NB7-4 lineage – to identify regions significantly bound by Hb in each sample', 'The rest of our analyses focussed on the significantly bound Hb loci in the two NB lineages . We used the R Bioconductor package DiffBind ( Ross-Innes et al', ', 2012 ) to identify 4224 differentially bound loci in the two NB lineages: 2007 that were enriched for Dam:Hb binding in the NB5-6 lineage , and 2217 that were enriched for Dam:Hb binding in the NB7-4 lineage ( Figure 4C; Supplementary file 1 ) . In addition , there were 2860 loci occupied by Dam:Hb in both neuroblast lineages ( Supplementary file 1 )', 'Importantly , while the read densities at individual loci are similar between replicates , they are strikingly different between the two neuroblast lineages . Next we represented the differentially bound loci using a volcano plot , where the magenta dots highlight the most significantly differential loci with more than 2-fold change and an FDR of\\xa0≤0 . 01 ( Figure 4D )', 'This threshold corresponds to 718 Hb enriched loci in NB5-6 lineage and 504 Hb enriched loci in NB7-4 lineage ( Supplementary file 1 ) , which is what we use for all subsequent analyses . The genes closest to the top five differentially occupied loci in each neuroblast are marked in this plot , and shown in Figure 4E , F', 'Based on these results , we conclude that Dam:Hb binds different loci in different neuroblasts . This clearly rules out the independent specification model where Hb has identical binding sites in different neuroblasts . We next wanted to understand how STFs might influence TTF genomic binding', 'Given the order of their action – STFs acting early in the neuroectoderm , and TTFs acting later in the delaminated NB – one possibility is that STFs generate different open/closed chromatin landscapes in each neuroblast such that TTFs have access to different loci in each neuroblast . This would predict that spatially distinct NBs would have different open/closed chromatin landscapes', 'To determine if this were indeed true , we performed chromatin accessibility profiling by Dam only ( CaTaDa ) , which exploits the ability of the Dam protein to bind open chromatin domains ( Aughey et al . , 2018 )', 'We first expressed Dam in all cells throughout embryogenesis using Da-Gal4 and observed excellent reproducibility between biological replicates both qualitatively and quantitatively ( Figure 5A , red tracks in C ) . We next wanted to confirm that Dam only binding in the embryo correlates with open chromatin domains , as has been shown in other cell types ( Aughey et al . , 2018 )', 'To do this , we analysed the Dam only signal around the DNase I hypersensitive sites ( peaks ) made available by the BDTNP consortium ( Thomas et al . , 2011 ) and found enriched Dam signals around the DNaseI peaks , as well as qualitative similarities between the two ( Figure 5B , compare red and ochre tracks in C )', 'We observed 6 , 708 Dam only peaks were aligned with DNase I hypersensitive peaks ( 44 . 6% of all Dam only peaks; 33 . 9% of all DNaseI peaks ) . A Monte Carlo analysis showed this was highly significant , detecting only 18 . 14% overlap with a set of random peaks ( 100 iterations , p-value\\xa0<\\xa01 e−300 , see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods )', 'These data suggest that Dam only can be used to detect open chromatin in embryos . We next sought to determine whether Dam only could be used to assay open chromatin in small pools of cells over a short period of time – for\\xa0example in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages at stage 12', 'We performed three biological replicates of Dam only for each neuroblast , and observed excellent reproducibility in all but one replicate , so we used the two best replicates henceforth ( Figure 5D ) . The reproducibility of the method can also be observed in the similar Dam binding patterns seen at representative control genes that are equally expressed in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages ( e . g', 'Kr , pdm2 and zfh2 ) , or along a large stretch of chromosome 4 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Next , we investigated whether there were global differences in chromatin states between the two neuroblast lineages . To do this , we first determined regions of significantly open chromatin in the two neuroblast lineages by running the MACS2 peak caller ( Zhang et al', ', 2008 ) on the four best replicates , which gave us a ‘peakset’ of significantly open chromatin in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages . We used these regions of open chromatin in both NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages to conduct a differential analysis using the DiffBind package ( Ross-Innes et al', ', 2012 ) and identified a total of 8 , 740 Dam only differentially bound loci , including 3656 loci in the NB5-6 lineage and 5084 loci in the NB7-4 lineage . These regions of differential chromatin accessibility have been represented as an ‘MA plot’ with the NB5-6 differential open chromatin loci at the top and the NB7-4 differential open chromatin loci at the bottom ( Figure 5E )', 'We conclude that there are global differences in the open chromatin landscape between the NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages .

To do this , we took all Dam:Hb-bound loci – both those specific for each neuroblast as well as those shared by both neuroblasts – and queried the state of the chromatin at these loci in each NB lineage', 'We found that Dam:Hb-bound loci in the NB5-6 lineage were enriched for open chromatin in that lineage ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ) , and similarly , Dam:Hb-bound loci in the NB7-4 lineage were enriched for open chromatin in that lineage ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1B )', 'This suggests that Dam:Hb binding is indeed correlated with chromatin accessibility domains in both NB lineages ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1C )', 'If Dam:Hb preferentially occupies regions of open chromatin , we reasoned that the differentially occupied Dam:Hb loci in each NB lineage ( lineage-specific Hb loci ) must be correlated with differentially open chromatin in that neuroblast lineage ( lineage-specific open chromatin )', 'Indeed , NB5-6-specific Dam:Hb bound loci showed a strong enrichment for open chromatin ( Figure 6A , blue lines ) ; strikingly , these same loci had closed chromatin in NB7-4 ( Figure 6A , green lines )', 'Similarly , NB7-4-specific Dam:Hb bound loci showed strong enrichment for open chromatin ( Figure 6B , green lines ) , while these same loci had closed chromatin in NB5-6 lineage ( Figure 6B , blue lines ) . Corresponding to this , we found 364 peaks , or 50 . 76% of the differential Dam:Hb peaks in NB5-6 overlapped with differentially open chromatin peaks in that lineage; and 164 peaks or 32', '74% of the differential Dam:Hb peaks in NB7-4 overlapped with differentially open chromatin peaks in that lineage .

We confirmed these findings at the top five differentially bound Dam:Hb loci in the two neuroblast lineages', 'All but two of these differentially bound loci were also identified in the differential chromatin analysis; even the two that were not picked up in the analysis ( sqz and mspo ) were qualitatively different between the two neuroblast lineages ( Figure 6D , E ) . We conclude that neuroblast-specific Dam:Hb binding occurs within neuroblast-specific accessible chromatin domains', 'This correlation suggests that either Hb binds where chromatin is open , or that Hb binding opens chromatin . The latter model seems unlikely , because both NB5-6 and NB7-4 are exposed to Hb expression , yet each neuroblast has specific open chromatin domains ( see Discussion )', 'We favor a model in which STFs generate neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains , leading to neuroblast-specific Hb occupancy . If spatial factors generate lineage-specific chromatin landscapes as the sequential specification model proposes , then it’s likely that lineage-specific STF occupancy will correspond to lineage specific chromatin accessibility', 'Gsb is one of the best studied STFs in the embryonic VNC . It has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient to determine the identity of the row 5 NBs ( Skeath et al . , 1995; Bhat , 1996 ) . Not only is Gsb a functionally validated STF , but Gsb ChIP-chip data from 0 to 12 hr embryos are publicly available ( Bonneaud et al . , 2017 )', 'As NB5-6 is a row 5 NB lineage specified by Gsb , it gave us the opportunity to test the sequential specification model more deeply . We asked whether Gsb occupancy was enriched at regions of accessible chromatin in the NB5-6 lineage . We plotted the Gsb ChIP-chip signal around all NB5-6 open chromatin loci and compared this with Gsb ChIP-chip signal around NB7-4 open chromatin loci', 'Indeed , we found an enrichment of Gsb signal specifically around NB5-6 open chromatin and not NB7-4 open chromatin ( Figure 7A ) . A Monte Carlo analysis found this enrichment to be highly significant ( average real NB5−6/NB7-4 fold change\\xa0=\\xa02 . 198 , average simulated NB5−6/NB7-4 fold change\\xa0=\\xa00 . 922 , 100 random iterations , p-value\\xa0=\\xa01 . 19119 e−62 )', 'This supports the hypothesis that lineage-specific STFs generate lineage-specific chromatin landscapes . Finally , we reasoned that if Hb preferentially binds to regions of accessible chromatin , and STF occupancy correlates with open chromatin in a lineage-specific manner , then the lineage-specific Hb occupancy that we observe in NB5-6 should correlate with lineage specific STF occupancy', 'We therefore plotted Gsb signal around NB5-6-enriched Hb loci and found a corresponding enrichment of Gsb occupancy at these regions ( Figure 7B , blue line ) . In contrast , the NB7-4-enriched Hb loci did not show any such enrichment ( Figure 7B , green line ) . A Monte Carlo analysis found this enrichment to be highly significant ( average real NB5-6/NB7-4 fold change\\xa0=\\xa02', '2 , average simulated NB5-6/NB7-4 fold change\\xa0=\\xa01 . 2 , 1000 random iterations , p-value\\xa0=\\xa06 . 54 e−10; see Materials\\xa0and\\xa0methods ) . Figure 7C represents this analysis graphically: the real signal difference between NB5-6 and NB7-4 ( Figure 7C , red line ) is much greater than the distribution of differences calculated over the 1000 random iterations ( Figure 7C , black line )', 'Furthermore , we found that of the 503 Hb enriched loci in NB5-6 , 101 had a Gsb peak within 2 Kb of the centre , whereas this number was 49 for NB7-4 . A Fisher’s exact test on these data found this spatial relationship to be highly significant for NB5-6 ( p\\xa0=\\xa08 . 78e-19 ) , but not for NB7-4 ( p\\xa0=\\xa00 . 078 )', 'We conclude that loci differentially bound by Hb in NB5-6 are enriched for Gsb occupancy , although we note that occupancy may occur at different times ( Gsb earlier , Hb later ) . Taken together , these data support the sequential specification model , where a transiently expressed STF ( e . g . Gsb ) sculpts a lineage-specific chromatin landscape in NB lineages ( eg', 'NB5-6 ) , this determines lineage-specific binding of TTFs ( e . g . Hb ) , which can in turn specify different neural fates in different NB lineages ( Figure 8 ) . \\n Since its first report , Targeted DamID has been used in multiple cell types , in both Drosophila and mammalian embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) , for mapping transcription factor binding ( Cheetham et al . , 2018; Tosti et al', ', 2018 ) , open chromatin domains ( Aughey et al . , 2018 ) , chromatin states ( Bonneaud et al . , 2017 ) , and for mapping paused or transcribed loci ( Southall et al . , 2013; Widmer et al . , 2018 ) . In all cases , the number of cells expressing the Dam constructs are relatively large:~10 , 000 FACS purified ESCs ( Cheetham et al', ', 2018 ) and\\xa0~5000 mushroom body neurons per brain ( Widmer et al . , 2018 ) . In our study we analyze the smallest percentage of cells to date - we calculate that there are between 8–12 cells in each hemisegment expressing Dam constructs; with a total of 11 segments that would give a maximum of 264 cells per embryo , or about 0 . 5% of the estimated 50 , 000 cells per embryo', 'Furthermore , we pushed the limits of the technique by allowing just 5 hr of Dam or Dam:Hb expression . It’s likely that this restrictive condition was successful in the case of a transcription factor-DNA interaction , which is stable during the time window; it might not be sufficient for factors such as RNA Pol II that require processivity through a gene', 'The ability to query transcription factor occupancy in such a precise manner – in a small subsets of cells over short periods of time – will encourage new uses of the method , such as studying the determination of cellular identities during development , upon reprogramming , or even in response to stimuli', 'We propose that the spatial factor Gsb opens genomic loci in NB5-6 , allowing the temporal factor Hb to bind loci that are not available in the adjacent Gsb-negative NB7-4', 'Although nothing is currently known about the role of Gsb in chromatin regulation , the closely related mammalian Pax3 and Pax7 transcription factors can recruit histone methyltransferase to promote open chromatin and increase gene expression ( McKinnell et al . , 2008; Diao et al . , 2012; Kawabe et al . , 2012 )', 'Moreover , Pax7 is a pioneer factor during pituitary development , opening\\xa0~2500 loci ( Budry et al . , 2012 ) . It would be informative to test whether Gsb can recruit trithorax complex methyltransferase to open genomic loci in row five neuroblasts , and whether this is required for row five neuroblast spatial identity and differential binding of Hb', 'The specific enrichment of Gsb occupancy at regions of accessible chromatin in NB5-6 is a striking result that supports our model despite different cell populations used for each experiment ( total embryonic vs . single NB lineage ) , different stages assayed ( 0–12 vs . 9–12 ) , and different methods used ( Dam vs . Gsb ChIP )', 'Despite these differences , we observed significant enrichment of Gsb-bound loci at open chromatin in a NB-specific manner: NB5-6 shows enrichment , whereas NB7-4 does not', 'Ideally , similar experiments need to be conducted with Dam:Gsb in NB5-6 and Dam:En in NB7-4 lineage to determine correspondence of STF occupancy and chromatin accessibility , as well as STF and TTF occupancy in the NB lineages . The advantage of the Drosophila model is that these relationships can be rigorously tested', 'For example , mutational inactivation of the relevant STF , while assaying chromatin accessibility or Hb occupancy in a lineage-specific way could reveal a causal link between the STF and chromatin landscape , and STF and Hb occupancy . Similarly , targeting chromatin modifiers to select loci while assaying Hb occupancy could demonstrate a causal link between chromatin state and Hb occupancy', 'To definitively rule out the possibility that Hb acts as a pioneer in these lineages , it may be feasible to misexpress or mutate Hb , to determine the effect on chromatin accessibility . These are technically difficult studies , beyond the scope of this paper . We show that\\xa0~1200 Hb-bound loci are different in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages , and that the chromatin at these sites is preferentially open', 'In some cases Dam:Hb occupancy is broader than Dam ( open chromatin ) occupancy; this could be due to Dam:Hb maintaining occupancy longer than Dam alone . The strong correlation between Dam:Hb binding and open chromatin could be due to Hb binding to previously opened chromatin domains , or Hb acting as a pioneer factor to open chromatin', 'We do not favor the latter mechanism because Hb binds some sites in NB5-6 but not in NB7-4 ( and vice versa ) showing that it is not sufficient to open chromatin . NB5-6 and NB7-4 develop adjacent to each other during neuroblast formation . They share a common lateral Msh+\\xa0spatial column , but are in different anterior/posterior spatial domains ( NB5-6 is Gsb+ , NB7-4 is En+ )', 'Although NB5-6 and NB7-4 make different early-born neurons , they share a common ability to make subperineurial glia and neurons that project through the posterior commissure ( Schmidt et al . , 1997; Schmid et al . , 1999 )', 'It is interesting to speculate that their common properties are due to their shared columnar spatial position , whereas their differences are due to different anterior/posterior spatial cues', 'Although we have provided evidence that Hb-bound loci are chosen from neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains , this does not rule out that sequential specification occurs via lineage-specific STFs/STF-target genes acting as Hb cofactors to bias Hb binding in each lineage', 'However , we have been unable to find any de novo DNA motif enriched within 1 kb of Hb-bound loci throughout the genome , either neuroblast-specific loci or within all Hb-bound loci . This is consistent with Hb acting independently , but we can’t rule out the possibility of Hb acting with co-factors', 'Our conclusions are in agreement with studies showing that DNA accessibility , not cooperative or competitive interactions , have the strongest impact on transcription factor binding ( Li et al . , 2008; Kaplan et al . , 2011 ) . Similarly , this model is supported by in vitro protein-DNA studies that eliminate chromatin state contribution to these interactions ( Guertin et al . , 2012 )', 'Using traditional methods of studying protein-DNA interactions , Hb targets in early embryogenesis have been well-characterized ( Hoch et al . , 1991; Struhl et al . , 1992; Rivera-Pomar et al . , 1995; Berman et al . , 2002 ) , yet little is known about Hb direct targets in the CNS , and nothing is known about neuroblast lineage-specific targets that specify lineage-specific neuronal identity', 'Here we’ve reported the first description of Hb occupancy in vivo within the genome of individual neuroblast lineages . Our study identified many loci that were similarly occupied in the two lineages , which are likely to consist of regulatory modules common to both lineages such as pan-neuronal specification or the progression of the temporal series', 'The latter example consists of Hb activating Kr and repressing pdm2 in most neuroblast lineages . Indeed we find that Hb binds to both loci in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages , confirming previous observations that Hb directly represses pdm2 and activates Kr in multiple neuroblast lineages ( Kambadur et al . , 1998; Tran et al . , 2010 )', 'Hb is also likely to directly repress zfh2 in most neuroblast lineages ( CQD , unpublished results ) and our data show that the zfh2 locus is indeed equivalently occupied in both neuroblast lineages . Apart from the commonly regulated loci , we identified over 100 loci that are differentially bound by Hb in NB5-6 or NB7-4 . These are excellent candidates for lineage-specific neuronal specification', 'Our study , coming almost two decades after the first descriptions of spatial and temporal patterning in Drosophila neural stem cells ( Isshiki et al . , 2001 ) , has for the first time explored the mechanism by which spatial and temporal factors could be integrated to generate neuroblast-specific neuronal progeny', 'Only recently has it been possible to probe TTF DNA-binding and chromatin landscapes within two distinct neuroblast lineages – due to the parallel advances in genetic tools , functional genomics , and our ability to manipulate the genome', 'Given the conservation of mechanisms in generating neural diversity in vertebrates and invertebrates , and exquisite ways in which the genome can now be manipulated in different organisms , it is now possible to determine if similar mechanisms generate diversity during vertebrate neurogenesis', 'Fly stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center ( Bloomington , IN USA ) and , unless otherwise stated , were grown on cornmeal media at 25°C .

      "\t ['How stem cells specified during development keep their non-differentiated quiescent state , and how they are reactivated , remain poorly understood . Here , we applied a Drosophila model to follow in vivo behavior of adult muscle precursors ( AMPs ) , the transient fruit fly muscle stem cells . We report that emerging AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles', 'AMPs keep their filopodia-based association with muscles throughout their dormant state but also when they start to proliferate , suggesting that muscles could play a role in AMP reactivation . Indeed , our genetic analyses indicate that muscles send inductive dIlp6 signals that switch the Insulin pathway ON in closely associated AMPs', 'This leads to the activation of Notch , which regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc . Altogether , we report that Drosophila AMPs display homing behavior to muscle niche and that the niche-driven Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs', 'Stem cells exhibit a remarkable capacity to keep a quiescent undifferentiated state , and then , once activated , contribute to developmental growth or damage tissue regeneration', 'Over the years , lineage tracing and serial transplantation assays have confirmed the presence of stem cell populations in many tissues in both invertebrate and vertebrate organisms ( for reviews , see [Voog and Jones , 2010; Simons and Clevers , 2011; Jiang and Edgar , 2012] )', 'These populations include multipotent cells , such as hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) which can give rise to a broad range of cell types ( Marquez-Curtis et al . , 2011 ) , and committed precursors , such as the satellite cells required for postnatal growth and the repair of a specific tissue , i . e . skeletal muscle ( Buckingham and Montarras , 2008 )', 'Importantly , stem cell activity and capacity to maintain tissue homeostasis depend on a specialized microenvironment called the niche . The stem cell niche was first documented in Drosophila ( Xie and Spradling , 2000 ) but it is now widely accepted that all adult stem cells reside within a niche that retains them and regulates their behavior ( Voog and Jones , 2010 )', 'Niches range in size and complexity ( Morrison and Spradling , 2008 ) . They may house a single stem cell , like the follicle stem cell ( FSC ) niche ( Nystul and Spradling , 2007 ) , or more than 10 germ stem cells ( GSCs ) , like the testis niche ( Wallenfang et al . , 2006 ) . Niches may also occupy a single spatially invariant location throughout adult life ( e . g', 'the GSC niche in Drosophila ) , or instead form a complex system of multiple niches distributed throughout tissues ( e . g . HSC niches ) ( for a review , see Morrison and Spradling , 2008 )', 'Like HSCs , which are able to reside in alternative niches , muscle stem cells ( satellite cells ) are scattered under the basal laminae of myofibers , which host them and contribute to their niche ( Collins et al . , 2005; Kuang et al . , 2007 ) . However , the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control niche occupancy by stem cells remain poorly understood', 'Recent work on myogenic progenitor cells , which ensure developmental muscle growth but also provide a source of cells that adopt satellite cell position , has shed new light on this issue ( Bröhl et al . , 2012 )', 'It has been shown that Notch signaling is required for the homing of emerging satellite cells by stimulating them to produce basal lamina , thus promoting their adhesion to myofibers ( Bröhl et al . , 2012 ) . Crucially , if the homing process is impaired , satellite cells are unable to receive inductive signals and thus efficiently contribute to muscle growth and regeneration', 'This makes gaining further insight into the homing of stem cells and their responsiveness to the signals emanating from the niche a key challenge . We have previously characterized the Drosophila muscle stem cells called adult muscle precursors ( AMPs ) that emerge during mid-embryogenesis and express muscle progenitor-specific markers such as the b-HLH transcription factor Twist ( Figeac et al', ', 2007 , 2010 ) . The AMPs lie dormant during embryonic and most of larval life but once activated they will proliferate to provide a source of myoblasts that ensure adult muscle growth and the regeneration of a subset of thoracic flight muscles', 'We also followed AMP cells in vivo using membrane-targeted GFP , and found that AMPs send out long cellular processes , and are interconnected ( Figeac et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , the capacity to send out cytoplasmic extensions and make interconnections has also been documented for quiescent satellite cells sited on myofibers ( Tavi et al . , 2010 )', 'All these features make AMPs similar to vertebrate satellite cells , prompting us to analyze their homing behavior and the mechanisms that drive their activation and exit from the dormant state . Our data show that emerging AMPs , in addition to long cellular projections , also send out thin filopodia that link them to the neighboring muscles , which behave as AMPs cell niche', 'We provide genetic evidence that muscles act via dIlp6 to switch the insulin pathway ON in AMPs and initiate AMP reactivation . This leads to a Deltex-involving activation of Notch , which positively regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc . \\n AMPs are specified at embryonic stage 12 and then remain quiescent and undifferentiated until the mid-second larval instar ( Bate et al . , 1991 )', 'We showed in earlier work that soon after their specification , embryonic AMPs form an interconnected network via long cytoplasmic extensions ( Figeac et al . , 2010 ) . A similar feature has also been reported for the quiescent vertebrate satellite cells , which are connected to each other and to the adjacent muscle through thin cytoplasmic extensions termed ‘tunneling nanotubes’ ( Tavi et al', ', 2010 ) . To examine the dynamics of AMP cell morphology and behavior in more detail , we generated an AMP sensor line , m6-gapGFP ( see Materials and methods ) that enabled us to visualize the shapes of AMPs in vivo . We focused our analyses on the abdominal AMPs , which when quiescent form a repeat pattern of six cells per hemisegment ( Figeac et al . , 2010 )', 'Initially , at embryonic stage 12 , AMPs appear spherical in shape and are separated from each other ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) , but a closer view ( Figure 1A ) shows that they send out numerous thin filopodia around their surface', \"This 'sensing behavior' also persists in later embryonic stages ( Figure 1B , C ) , in which AMPs become more elongated and send out long cytoplasmic extensions ( Figure 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) to form an interconnected network ( Figeac et al . , 2010 )\", \"The long cellular processes follow the main neural branches of the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) ( Figure 1C' , arrows ) , while the short filopodia display dynamic and irregular patterns and seem not to be attracted by the PNS nerves ( Figure 1C' , arrowheads ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 08497 . 003Figure 1 .

We previously reported that a regulatory element of Enhancer of split m6 ( E ( spl ) m6; m6 ) gene carrying potential Supressor of Hairless ( Su ( H ) ) binding sites ( Rebeiz et al', ', 2002 ) drives expression specifically in quiescent AMPs ( Figeac et al . , 2010 ) . This suggests that the Notch pathway is activated in embryonic AMPs , but the question of whether it plays a role in setting quiescent versus proliferative AMP state remained unsolved', 'Here , we showed that m6-Gal4-targeted expression of the Notch intracellular domain ( NICD ) in embryonic AMPs does not alter their quiescence in embryos ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 )', 'However , in the same NICD context , there were significantly higher numbers of AMPs in third-instar larvae , suggesting that Notch reactivates AMPs in larval stages and promotes their proliferation ( Figure 4F , J , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—source data 1 )', 'The reduced number of AMPs in larvae with m6-driven Notch attenuation ( Figure 4G , J , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—source data 1 ) further supports this observation', 'As the decrease in AMP numbers in a Notch-RNAi context has not been associated with a reduced level of GFP driven by the same m6 regulatory element ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) , we hypothesize that a low Notch level is sufficient to maintain m6 activity but we cannot rule out a possibility that perdurance of Gal4 and GFP in larval stages plays role as well', 'In vertebrate satellite cells , Notch regulates the asymmetric divisions controlling the number of reserve muscle stem cells that , at the end of the\\xa0cell cycle , sit on muscles and remain undifferentiated ( Kuang et al . , 2007 )', 'The activated AMPs do not seem to divide asymmetrically , as they did not increase in number in the numb RNAi context ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) and no reactivated AMPs were found to express the asymmetric cell division marker Numb-CD2-GFP ( Rebeiz et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 )', 'Notch thus plays a novel role in AMPs , promoting their proliferation without driving asymmetric cell divisions . Besides the Insulin and Notch pathways , a recent study ( Li et al . , 2012 ) found that in vertebrates the transcription factor Myc is also involved in regulating myoblast proliferation during muscle development and regeneration', 'This prompted us to test whether Myc also regulated the proliferation of AMPs . Indeed , dMyc acts as a positive regulator of AMP reactivation ( Figure 4H–K , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—source data 1 ) , thus providing evidence that the proliferation of muscle stem cells is regulated by the same set of genes in both Drosophila and vertebrates', 'To gain a better understanding of the functional link between Insulin , Notch and dMyc in AMP cell behavior , we analyzed their activity in reactivated AMPs .

Next , using the same approach , we tested dMyc protein levels in AMP-targeted gain and loss of Notch function , and found that Notch increased nuclear dMyc levels ( Figure 5D , D'' , Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—source data 1 ) , suggesting that Notch acts upstream of dMyc\", 'The sum of these observations prompted us to determine whether dMyc acted as an effector of Insulin and Notch pathways , and whether Notch functioned downstream of Insulin during AMP proliferation', 'We found that lowering Notch or dMyc levels in AMPs expressing InRCA led to an attenuation of the AMP overproliferation phenotype , indicating that both Notch and dMyc act downstream of the Insulin pathway ( Figure 5E–G , L , M , Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—source data 1 )', 'We also observed that the increased number of AMPs generated in the NICD-overexpressing context was dMyc-dependent ( Figure 5H , I , L , M , Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—source data 1 ) , indicating that dMyc acts as an effector of Notch in reactivated AMPs', 'Taken together , these data establish an Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade governing the exit of AMPs from the dormant state and promoting their proliferation ( Figure 5M )', 'However , as NICD overexpression induces higher numbers of AMPs than InRCA overexpression ( Figure 5L , Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—source data 1 ) , we cannot rule out the possibility that Notch also acts in an InR-independent way', 'The increased levels of intracellular Notch in AMPs expressing the activated form of Insulin receptor ( InRCA ) suggested that Insulin promotes Notch pathway activity during AMP reactivation', 'A similar observation was recently reported in Drosophila intestinal stem cells in which proliferation and differentiation is finely tuned by the interplay between the Insulin and Notch pathways ( Foronda et al . , 2014 ) . However , the issue of whether the Insulin-dependent regulation of Notch involves conventional Delta/Serrate signal transduction has never been addressed', 'We thus tested whether the attenuation of Delta or Serrate in the muscle or PNS cells with which AMPs are associated impacts on AMP proliferation ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—source data 1 ) . We found that knocking down Notch ligands in direct AMP cell neighbors has no effect on AMP reactivation ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—source data 1 )', 'Similarly , expressing in AMPs a dominant-negative form of Notch receptor ( ECN ) devoid of intracellular domain and known to efficiently repress canonical Notch signaling ( Rebay et al . , 1993 ) had no effect on AMP cell numbers ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—source data 1 ) , suggesting that Notch activation in AMPs could occur in a ligand-independent way', 'To further explore the Insulin-Notch pathway linkage , we tested the expression of the ubiquitin ligase Deltex , which is known to play a role in ligand-independent intracellular activation of Notch by promoting its mono-ubiquitinated state ( Hori et al . , 2011 )', 'We found that punctate cytoplasmic Deltex expression increased significantly in AMPs expressing InRCA compared to the control ( Figure 6A–C and Figure 6—source data 1 )', 'Consistently with this observation , targeted expression of Deltex in AMPs or attenuation of its repressor Supressor of Deltex ( Su ( Dx ) ) both led to an overproliferation phenotype ( Figure 6D , E , I and Figure 6—source data 1 ) . Hori et al', '( 2011 ) proposed that non-visual β-arrestin homolog Kurtz ( Krz ) binds together with Deltex to the Notch receptor , leading to its poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation . We tested Krz function in AMPs and found that both increasing and decreasing Kurtz levels leads to overproliferation of AMPs ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6—source data 1 )', 'This suggested that the stoichiometry of Krz and Dx levels regulates Notch activation in AMPs ( see schemes in Figure 6—figure supplement 2 )', 'Indeed , reducing Deltex by RNAi-based attenuation or by overexpressing Su ( Dx ) led to an increased number of AMPs ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6-source data 1 ) similar to that observed in the Deltex overexpression context ( Figure 6D , I and Figure 6—source data 1 ) , whereas simultaneous overexpression of Deltex and Kurtz had no effect on AMP numbers ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6—source data 1 )', 'It has also been reported that Shrub , a component of the ESCRT-III complex that promotes Notch degradation in multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) , acts as a negative regulator of ligand-independent Notch activity ( Hori et al . , 2011 ) . We thus tested whether Shrub attenuation could promote AMP proliferation', 'We found that a downregulation of Shrub in AMP cells results in a burst of AMP proliferation ( Figure 6F , I and Figure 6—source data 1 ) .

We first tested mutants for dIlp2 , dIlp5 and dIlp6 ( Grönke et al', ', 2010 ) and found that AMP proliferation was only inhibited in a dIlp6 loss-of-function background ( Figure 7A–C , J , Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—source data 1 )', 'To identify the source of the dIlp6 , we expressed a dominant-negative ( DN ) form of Drosophila dynamin protein called Shibire ( Shi-DN ) in larval muscles , neural cells and glial cells ( Figure 7D–F , J , Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—source data 1 ) . Shi-DN affects vesicular trafficking and thus inhibits the secretion of signaling molecules from the cell ( Seugnet et al . , 1997 )', 'We found that blocking the secretion from larval muscles affected the proliferation of AMPs and reduced their numbers ( Figure 7D , Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—source data 1 ) , whereas no effect was observed when Shi-DN was expressed in either neural cells ( Figure 7E , J , Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—source data 1 ) or glial cells ( Figure 7F , J , Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—source data 1 )', 'A key role of muscles in producing dIlp6 and inducing AMP proliferation is further supported by the reduction of AMP numbers in larvae with attenuated dIlp6 expression in muscles but not in glial cells ( Figure 7G , I , J , Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—source data 1 )', 'Conversely , an increased number of AMPs was detected in muscle-specific overexpression of dIlp6 ( Figure 7H , J , Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—source data 1 )', 'To understand the link between persisting cellular extensions and reactivation of AMPs , we attempted to modulate filopodia formation by attenuating the DAAM gene encoding one of formins known to be involved in filopodia dynamics at axon growth cones ( Gonçalves-Pimentel et al . , 2011 )', 'We found that DAAM-attenuation leads to an altered AMP proliferation in third-instar larvae ( Figure 7M and Figure 7—source data 1 ) that correlates with reduced length of cellular protrusions observed in DAAM-RNAi second-instar larvae ( Figure 7L , compare to wild-type shown in Figure 7K ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 08497 . 025Figure 7', 'Larval muscles regulate AMP proliferation via Insulin-like peptide dIlp6 .

The stem-like Drosophila AMPs specified in mid-embryogenesis lie at the origin of all the adult Drosophila muscles ( Bate et al', ', 1991 ) , but the lack of appropriate genetic tools means we still know little of their behavior and niche requirements . Here , we monitored the morphology of embryonic AMPs using a m6-gapGFP sensor line and found that in addition to the long cytoplasmic extensions that connect AMPs together ( Figeac et al', ', 2010 ) , they also send out numerous thin filopodia and display homing behavior to a set of surrounding muscles', 'The newly\\xa0specified AMPs initially display spherical shapes with short thin filopodia distributed around their surface , but shortly afterwards they start to send filopodia in a more directional way , become more elongated extending along the neighboring muscles and connecting them via stabilized cellular protrusions', 'Thus , the dormant AMPs , like vertebrate satellite cells , adapt their shapes to muscle niche and became tightly associated with muscle fibers , an assumption supported by dotty integrin expression associated with both AMP cell bodies and their muscle-connecting filopodia', 'Interestingly , the quiescent satellite cells also have the capacity to produce cellular extensions , called nanotubes , connecting muscle stem cells to the muscle fiber ( Tavi et al . , 2010 ) , which further argues that AMPs and satellite cells display similar behavior', 'How the homing of satellite cells and AMPs is regulated remains to be explored , but the Notch pathway , which is activated in AMPs and required to produce basal lamina by adhering to muscle satellite cells ( Bröhl et al . , 2012 ) , appears to play a central role', 'It is also unknown how satellite cells behave during their reactivation , how they adapt their shapes , and when they lose nanotube connections to muscle niche . Using membrane-targeted GFP enabled us to follow the behavior of AMPs and , for the first time , to visualize them at the time they are reactivated from the dormant state', 'Our data reveal that the AMPs maintain their elongated shapes with filopodia extending along the muscle niche during the first events of proliferation , which supports the view that muscles play an instructive role during AMP reactivation', 'AMPs are reactivated from their quiescent state at the mid-second larval instar , but the signals and intrinsic molecular mechanisms regulating their entry into proliferation remain unknown . It has previously been shown that the Insulin/TOR signaling pathway controls the exit of Drosophila neural stem cells from their dormant state ( Chell and Brand , 2010; Sousa-Nunes et al . , 2011 )', 'Global gene expression profiling also revealed that Insulin Growth Factor ( IGF ) signaling components are upregulated in activated satellite cells ( Pallafacchina et al . , 2010 ) . We therefore tested whether the Insulin pathway could reactivate Drosophila AMPs', 'We found that Insulin and TOR signaling components effectively promote the exit of AMPs from their dormant state , while also positively regulating AMP proliferation . However , increased Insulin/TOR signaling alone is not sufficient to end AMP quiescence during embryonic stages , suggesting a more complex regulatory cascade for the control of AMP reactivation', 'It has been demonstrated that the reactivation of dormant neuroblasts is driven by a nutritional checkpoint during the second larval instar ( Chell and Brand , 2010; Sousa-Nunes et al . , 2011 )', 'Given that AMPs also remain quiescent in nutrient deprivation settings , we hypothesize that a nutrient-dependent switch in metabolism may contribute to AMP reactivation , and might thus be responsible for the inability of embryonic AMPs to enter proliferation', 'Quiescent stem cells have few mitochondria and use anaerobic metabolism , whereas activated cells switch their metabolism to a high ATP energy output aerobic glycolysis in order to support the high-level macromolecular synthesis required for proliferation , ( Montarras et al . , 2013 )', 'Interestingly , genes encoding glycolytic and pyruvate metabolic enzymes known to be downstream of Insulin ( Tixier et al . , 2013 ) act as upstream regulators of the Notch pathway ( Saj et al . , 2010 ) , providing a potential link between metabolism and Notch in regulating the quiescent versus activated state of stem cells', 'A well-known feature of quiescent non-differentiated cells is that they keep Notch activated ( Bjornson et al . , 2012 ) , but Notch receptor activation can also trigger proliferation ( Baonza and Garcia-Bellido , 2000 ) , including the proliferation of satellite cells ( Qin et al . , 2013 )', 'Here , we followed the GFP expression driven by a Notch-responsive element of the m6 gene and found that dormant AMPs are GFP-positive , which suggests that , like in satellite cells , Notch is involved in setting the AMP quiescent state', 'On the other hand , we also observed that during larval stages Notch promotes AMP proliferation , indicating that Notch might play a dual role , again like in satellite cells ( Qin et al . , 2013 ) . Notch acting in concert with Numb is also known to control asymmetric divisions of adult satellite cells ( Kuang et al . , 2007 )', 'However , in Drosophila , Numb has no impact on AMP proliferation , indicating a novel role for Notch in promoting symmetric cell divisions of AMPs . As Notch regulates the proliferation of cancer cells via Myc ( Palomero et al . , 2006; Weng et al . , 2006; Liao et al . , 2007; Ishikawa et al', ', 2013 ) , and Myc promotes the proliferation of myoblasts during development and regeneration ( Li et al . , 2012 ) , we tested whether dMyc was involved in AMP reactivation in Drosophila . Our data show that dMyc is indeed required for AMP reactivation and proliferation . Genetic rescue experiments show that Notch acts downstream of the Insulin pathway and dMyc functions downstream of Notch', 'Interestingly , it has been shown that coordinated activation of Insulin and Notch pathways also regulates the self-renewal and differentiation of intestinal Drosophila stem cells ( Foronda et al . , 2014 ) . Here , our data suggest that Notch pathway activation downstream of Insulin involves Deltex and is likely ligand-independent ( Figure 7 )', 'The role of ligand-independent Notch activation , which involves interaction with Hif-α , has been reported as essential for normal Drosophila blood cell development ( Mukherjee et al . , 2011 ) . Our findings further highlight the biological importance of non-canonical Notch activation and provide early evidence for its role during stem cell-niche interactions', 'The key role of the Insulin pathway in AMP proliferation raised an obvious question as to the source and identity of the Insulin Receptor ( InR ) ligand initiating AMP reactivation . In Drosophila , three Insulin-like peptides ( dIlp2 , dIlp3 and dIlp5 ) secreted to the hemolymph by mNSC cells control the systemic growth of the organism ( Brogiolo et al', ', 2001 ) , whereas dIlp6 produced by the glial cells acts locally and promotes the proliferation of the neuroblasts ( Sousa-Nunes et al . , 2011 ) . Here we show that dIlp6 is also crucial for reactivating AMPs from their dormant state', 'On the other hand , the lack of substantial effect on AMP proliferation observed in dIlp2 , dIlp3 and dIlp5 mutants suggests that dIlps secreted to the hemolymph are unable to reactivate AMPs and that direct contact between AMPs and surrounding muscles via long cellular protrusions promotes the reception of local , muscle-derived dIlp6 by the closely-associated AMPs', 'Thus , like for satellite cells ( Chakkalakal et al . , 2012 ) , muscle appears to play a niche role while also proving essential to the activation of quiescent AMPs ( Figure 8 ) . Whether the Insulin/IGF signals play a conserved role in this process remains an open question , but the finding that numerous IGF signaling components are upregulated in activated satellite cells ( Pallafacchina et al', ', 2010 ) argues for this possibility . Taken together , our data reveal several new features of the transient Drosophila muscle stem cells called AMPs , particularly their direct contact with muscles , which behave as an AMPs niche', 'Muscle appears to be the source of local inductive Insulin signals that reactivate AMPs and , via non-canonical Notch and its target dMyc , induce their proliferation in larval stages ( Figure 8 ) . If all the components of this cascade prove to be evolutionarily conserved , it is tempting to speculate that this same cascade may also control the reactivation of human satellite cells', 'All Drosophila melanogaster stocks were grown on standard medium at 25°C .

      "\t ['The epigenetic mechanisms that enable specialized astrocytes to retain neurogenic competence throughout adult life are still poorly understood . Here we show that astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells ( NSCs ) in the adult mouse subventricular zone ( SVZ ) express the histone methyltransferase EZH2', 'This Polycomb repressive factor is required for neurogenesis independent of its role in SVZ NSC proliferation , as Ink4a/Arf-deficiency in Ezh2-deleted SVZ NSCs rescues cell proliferation , but neurogenesis remains defective . Olig2 is a direct target of EZH2 , and repression of this bHLH transcription factor is critical for neuronal differentiation', 'Furthermore , Ezh2 prevents the inappropriate activation of genes associated with non-SVZ neuronal subtypes . In the human brain , SVZ cells including local astroglia also express EZH2 , correlating with postnatal neurogenesis', 'Thus , EZH2 is an epigenetic regulator that distinguishes neurogenic SVZ astrocytes , orchestrating distinct and separable aspects of adult stem cell biology , which has important implications for regenerative medicine and oncogenesis', 'It is now appreciated that , like neurons , astrocytes serve multiple functions in the adult brain and are heterogeneous in their identity ( Zhang and Barres , 2010; Molofsky et al . , 2012 )', 'While astrocytes are distributed widely throughout the brain , only those located in the subventricular zone ( SVZ ) of the lateral ventricles and subgranular zone ( SGZ ) of the hippocampus serve as neurogenic NSCs for all of adult life ( Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla , 2009 )', 'Though several transcriptional regulators have been identified that distinguish neurogenic astroglia ( Hsieh , 2012 ) , what makes adult NSCs epigenetically distinct from non-neurogenic astrocytes remains an outstanding question . Understanding these differences may yield novel insights into how adult stem cells retain the competence to self-renew and generate multiple specialized cell types', 'In particular , Polycomb group ( PcG ) proteins , which comprise a chromatin-remodeling system that mediates transcriptional repression , have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the development of various cell populations ( Aloia et al . , 2013 ) . PcG proteins assemble into two functionally distinct Polycomb repressive complexes , PRC1 and PRC2', 'PRC2 typically contains the core components SUZ12 , EED , RbAp46/48 , and EZH2 , a histone methyltransferase responsible for catalyzing histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation ( H3K27me3 )', 'In the prevailing model of PcG-mediated repression , PRC2 is targeted to specific loci , and the deposited H3K27me3 marks serve as a platform to recruit PRC1 , leading to transcriptional silencing ( Margueron and Reinberg , 2011 ) . Most of what is known about PRC2 developmental function derives from studies of the embryo', 'In the early developing forebrain , conditional deletion of Ezh2 results in a shortened period of neuronal production related to lack of precursor cell proliferation and premature NSC differentiation ( Pereira et al', ', 2010 ) ; in contrast , deletion of Ezh2 a few days later during corticogenesis causes an increase in the duration of neurogenesis and a delay in astrocyte differentiation ( Hirabayashi et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , EZH2 , in concert with other PcG members , appears to orchestrate the temporal alterations in embryonic NSC behavior', 'In contrast to the dynamic and transient nature of embryonic NSCs , adult NSCs are relatively stable in their differentiation potential and are maintained for all of adult life . Postnatal NSCs lacking PRC1 component BMI1 are defective for self-renewal , in part due to the derepression of cell cycle inhibitors encoded by the Ink4a/Arf locus ( also known as Cdkn2a ) ( Molofsky et al . , 2003 )', 'Whether PcG factors are required for other aspects of adult neurogenesis such as lineage specification is not known . In this study , we found EZH2 expression to be a distinguishing feature of neurogenic astrocytes in the adult mouse brain . Ezh2 in SVZ NSCs was required for distinct functions , regulating both cell proliferation and neuronal lineage specification', 'To enable SVZ NSC self-renewal , EZH2 directly repressed the Ink4a/Arf locus . Ink4a/Arf-deletion reversed the proliferation defect of Ezh2-deleted NSCs , but neurogenesis was still greatly impaired . In SVZ cells , EZH2 directly targeted Olig2 , and repression of this bHLH transcription factor was required for neuronal differentiation', 'Furthermore , genome-wide transcript and chromatin analyses revealed a role for EZH2 in preventing the aberrant activation of transcriptional regulators that specify alternative neuronal lineages . In the human brain , EZH2 was also expressed in astroglia and neuronal precursors of the early infant SVZ , suggesting that this PRC2 factor plays key roles in postnatal human neurogenesis', 'Taken together , these data indicate that EZH2 is a critical epigenetic determinant for the maintenance of multipotent astroglia , enabling both proliferation and cell fate specification of an adult stem cell population . \\n EZH2 is expressed widely in the embryonic brain , including in radial glial cells ( Pereira et al', ', 2010 ) , which are the primary precursor of all major neural cells in the adult brain ( Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla , 2009 ) . While the PRC1 component BMI1 is widely expressed in mature neurons and astrocytes ( Chatoo et al . , 2009 ) , EZH2 expression in the postnatal brain has not been examined', 'Using immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , we detected EZH2 in most cells of the cortex and striatum at postnatal day 7 ( P7 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) .

Upon arriving into the core of the OB , DCX+ neuroblasts migrate tangentially into the granule cell layer ( GCL ) where they differentiate into NeuN+ neurons', 'Interestingly , DCX+ cells away from the OB core had decreased levels of EZH2 , and NeuN+ neurons that populate the GCL were mostly EZH2-negative ( Figure 1G ) . These data indicate that EZH2 is expressed in SVZ neurogenic astroglia , their immature daughter cells , and is gradually downregulated upon terminal differentiation', 'Both SVZ type B1 cells and local non-neurogenic , postmitotic ependymal cells arise from local radial glia shortly after birth ( Merkle et al . , 2004; Spassky et al . , 2005 ) . Notably , S100β+ ependymal cells were EZH2-negative ( Figure 1D )', 'In addition , while almost all EZH2+ cells ( >99% ) in the postnatal SVZ express the cell cycle marker Ki67+ , only a small percentage ( ∼7% ) of Ki67+ cells located away from the SVZ were EZH2+ ( Figure 1E , data not shown ) , suggesting that EZH2 expression is not a strict consequence of cell proliferation', 'To study Ezh2-deficency in SVZ NSCs , we used mice with conditional alleles of Ezh2 ( Ezh2F/F ) and the hGFAP-cre transgene , which drives Cre-mediated recombination in the precursors of the cerebellar granule cell layer , hippocampal dentate gyrus , and SVZ NSCs ( Han et al . , 2008 )', 'hGFAP-cre;Ezh2F/F animals were born at expected Mendelian ratios and did not exhibit gross morphological or behavioral defects as compared to their hGFAP-cre;Ezh2F/+ or non-hGFAP-cre littermates ( hereafter referred to as controls ) .

When primary NSs were dissociated and recultured at clonal density , these secondary Ezh2 Δ/Δ NSs were also much smaller than controls , further indicating that the proliferation of self-renewing SVZ NSCs requires Ezh2 ( Figure 3E )', 'We next asked whether Ink4a/Arf-deficiency can rescue the proliferation defect of Ezh2-deleted SVZ NSCs . Ink4a/Arf-null SVZ NSCs with Ezh2-deletion ( henceforth Ezh2Δ/Δ;Ink4a/Arf−/− ) generated primary and secondary NSs that were similar in size than those from Control;Ink4a/Arf−/− NSCs ( Figure 3D , E )', 'Thus , Ink4a/Arf-deficiency reverses the self-renewing proliferation defect of Ezh2-deleted NSCs . Taken together , these data indicate that EZH2-mediated repression of the Ink4a/Arf locus is critical for the self-renewing proliferation of SVZ astroglia', 'Given the well-characterized role of EZH2 in the regulation of cell proliferation in other stem cell niches ( Aldiri and Vetter , 2012 ) , we investigated whether the neurogenesis defect of Ezh2 Δ/Δ SVZ NSCs was primarily a result of decreased cell proliferation', 'Ezh2 Δ/Δ cultures exhibited an approximately 40% decrease in 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine ( BrdU ) incorporation as compared to control cultures; this decrease in proliferation was accompanied by a >6x decrease in the number of Tuj1+ cells after 7 d of differentiation ( Figure 3F , left blue column )', 'Consistent with our NS culture results , Ink4a/Arf-deficiency rescued the proliferation defect associated with Ezh2-deletion ( Figure 3F , right blue column ) .

Taken together , these results indicate that EZH2 has a role in SVZ neurogenesis that is distinct from its function in Ink4a/Arf repression', 'Furthermore , by rescuing only cell proliferation and not neuronal differentiation , Ink4a/Arf-deficiency enabled us to investigate additional roles for EZH2 in the neurogenic capacity of this astroglial population . We next tested whether reexpression of Ezh2 could rescue neurogenesis in Ezh2-deleted , Ink4a/Arf-null SVZ NSCs', 'We infected Ezh2Δ/Δ;Ink4a/Arf−/− SVZ NSCs with a lentivirus ( LV ) that expresses Ezh2 and GFP ( Ezh2 LV ) or a control GFP vector ( Control LV ) one day before the initiation of differentiation .

Given the results of the Ezh2 rescue experiments , we reasoned that EZH2 might promote neurogenesis by catalyzing H3K27me3 at specific loci during differentiation', 'To identify such genes , we first performed ChIP-seq analysis of SVZ NSC monolayer cultures with antibodies to H3K27me3 to detect loci that did not have this chromatin modification before differentiation . As expected , the housekeeping gene Gapdh was not repressed with H3K27me3 ( Figure 4A )', 'In contrast , Hoxa2b , a homeobox gene that is not normally expressed in neural cells , was highly enriched with this chromatin modification ( Figure 4A ) .

In contrast , H3K27me3 was strikingly increased at Olig2 in neuroblasts as compared to the GFAP+ , Nestin+ cell population ( Figure 4B )', 'Furthermore , ChIP analysis of acutely isolated SVZ cells identified EZH2 and H3K27me3 enrichment at Olig2 ( Figure 3A , B ) , indicating that Olig2 is likely a direct target of EZH2 in the SVZ in vivo . This chromatin analysis suggested that Ezh2 is required for Olig2 repression during neuronal differentiation', 'To investigate whether Olig2 is expressed aberrantly in Ezh2-deleted SVZ cells , we first performed ICC on Ezh2Δ/Δ;Ink4a/Arf−/− and Control;Ink4a/Arf−/− SVZ NSC cultures . After 1 , 2 , and 4 d of differentiation , Ezh2-deleted cultures had a greater proportion of OLIG2+ cells ( Figure 4C , D )', 'To ask whether Ezh2-deleted SVZ cells also generate greater numbers of OLIG2+ cells in vivo , we injected BrdU into mice 1 hr before sacrifice and analyzed the SVZ for BrdU+ , OLIG2+ cells . Compared to controls , there were greater than twofold more BrdU+ , OLIG2+ cells in the SVZ of hGFAP-cre;Ezh2F/F mice ( Figure 4E , F )', 'Thus , Ezh2-deletion in SVZ NSCs results in aberrant expression of OLIG2 both in vitro and in vivo . To test whether increased OLIG2 levels in SVZ cells inhibits neurogenesis , we expressed Olig2 with a doxycycline ( Dox ) -inducible Olig2 lentiviral vector ( LV-GFP-tetO-Olig2 ) in SVZ NSC cultures derived from rtTA-mice ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2A )', 'When we added Dox during early differentiation ( Day 0–3 ) , the number of Tuj1+ neuroblasts after 7 d of differentiation was greatly reduced as compared to no-Dox control ( Figure 4G , Figure 4—figure supplement 2B ) . Interestingly , when Dox was added shortly after the onset of differentiation ( Day 3–7 ) , neurogenesis was not affected ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2C )', 'Thus , aberrant OLIG2 expression during early stages of differentiation inhibits neurogenesis from SVZ NSCs . We next asked whether reduction of Olig2 in Ezh2-deleted SVZ NSCs could rescue neuronal differentiation', 'Cells infected with a lentiviral short hairpin RNA Olig2 knockdown vector ( LV-GFP-Olig2-shRNA ) exhibited significantly reduced OLIG2 expression as compared to cells infected with the LV-GFP-Luciferase-shRNA control ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2D )', 'Ezh2Δ/Δ;Ink4a/Arf−/− SVZ NSCs with Olig2-knockdown produced nearly threefold more Tuj1+ cells after 3 d of differentiation as compared to cells infected with the control vector with no significant increase of GFAP-positive cells ( Figure 4H , Figure 4—figure supplement 2E , F )', 'Olig2-knockdown in Control;Ink4a/Arf−/− SVZ NSCs did not increase neurogenesis , suggesting that only aberrant Olig2 expression in Ezh2-deleted cells inhibits neuronal differentiation ( Figure 4H )', 'Of note , Ezh2Δ/Δ;Ink4a/Arf−/− NSCs with Olig2-knockdown did not generate Tuj1+ cells with the same efficiency as Control;Ink4a/Arf−/− SVZ NSCs , indicating that EZH2 likely regulates other genes for efficient neurogenesis', 'Thus , we performed microarray and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq analysis to identify specific transcriptional modules that required EZH2 for proper transcriptional repression ( Figure 4—figure supplements 3 and 4 )', 'Interestingly , many of the genes that exhibited Ezh2-dependent transcriptional repression encode for homeodomain transcription factors involved in the production of neuronal subtypes that are temporally and spatially distinct from OB interneurons ( Figure 4—figure supplement 5 )', 'Taken together , these data indicate that SVZ NSCs require EZH2 for the repression of specific sets of genes including Olig2 for proper neuronal lineage specification . Astrocytes isolated from the adult human SVZ can serve as NSCs in vitro ( Sanai et al . , 2004 ) , and adult human SVZ neurogenesis has been described in vivo ( Sanai et al . , 2004; Quinones-Hinojosa et al . , 2006; Curtis et al', ', 2007 ) . While the infant human SVZ has large numbers of DCX+ neuroblasts , this neurogenesis declines sharply during the first 18 months of life ( Sanai et al . , 2011 ) .

In the 1-week-old infant , EZH2 was prominent in the SVZ ( Figure 5C ) , but sporadic in non-neurogenic regions more distant from the ventricle wall ( data not shown )', 'In the 1-week old SVZ , EZH2 was detected in a subset of GFAP+ cells as well as clusters of DCX + cells ( Figure 5D ) , indicating that EZH2 is expressed in cell types that correspond to cells of the neurogenic lineage . However , by 18 months of age , when SVZ neurogenesis is nearly extinct ( Sanai et al . , 2011 ) , EZH2+ cells were not observed in the SVZ ( Figure 5C )', 'Thus , EZH2 is expressed in SVZ astrocytes and neuroblasts during the period of postnatal human neurogenesis . \\n Despite many immunohistological , ultrastructural , and electrophysiological similarities between SVZ astrocytes and those in non-neurogenic brain regions , it is clear that astrocytes in the SVZ are distinct in their ability to produce neurons for all of adult life', 'Our data indicate that EZH2 is a distinguishing feature of SVZ astrocytes and in part underlies the epigenetic basis of this unique form of astrocyte heterogeneity ( Figure 6 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02439', '018 Astrocytes throughout the brain arise from radial glia , the primary multipotent neural precursor cells population of the developing brain ( Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla , 2009 ) . While most astrocytes do not generate neurons in the early postnatal brain , SVZ astrocytes retain the ability to produce neurons and glia throughout life', 'Thus , conceptually , SVZ astrocytes appear to have ‘preserved’ the multi-lineage developmental potential of their radial glial cell origin , whereas non-neurogenic astrocytes apparently ‘lose’ this stem cell characteristic ( Gonzales-Roybal and Lim , 2013 ) . The expression of EZH2 strongly correlated with the neurogenic potential of glial cells along this developmental continuum', 'EZH2 is expressed in embryonic radial glia and is required for proper cortical neuron differentiation ( Hirabayashi et al . , 2009; Pereira et al . , 2010 ) . We detected EZH2 expression in early postnatal radial glia , including those that give rise to the SVZ astrocytes', 'While EZH2 expression decreased over time in non-neurogenic brain regions , this PRC2 factor remained highly expressed in SVZ astrocytes into adulthood . Interestingly , PRC1 component BMI1—which is required for SVZ NSC self-renewal ( Molofsky et al', ', 2003 ) —does not become similarly restricted to neurogenic astrocytes and is instead also expressed in mature neurons and astrocytes of the adult brain ( Chatoo et al . , 2009 )', 'This suggests that BMI1 , while clearly required for adult neurogenesis , is not a distinguishing feature of SVZ astrocytes; instead , BMI1 may function more broadly in a variety of mature and immature neural cell types . During the first 2 weeks of life , astrocytes isolated from the cortex can give rise to multipotent NS cultures ( Laywell et al . , 2000 )', 'After these first 2 postnatal weeks , cortical astrocytes lose their ability to generate such neurogenic cell cultures . Intriguingly , this reported loss of neurogenic competence during postnatal development parallels our observation that EZH2 was no longer detected in the cortex by P15', 'Furthermore , the ectopic expression of EZH2 in cultured postnatal astrocytes induces the expression of Nestin and other markers of radial glia ( Sher et al . , 2011 ) . Future studies may address whether re-expression of EZH2 in non-SVZ astrocytes can enable neurogenesis or their directed transdifferentiation into neurons in vivo for potential therapeutic purposes', 'Acute deletion of Ezh2 in SVZ NSCs resulted in decreased neurogenesis , and this deficiency in part related to reduced cell proliferation . As has been found in other stem cell systems ( Aloia et al . , 2013 ) , in SVZ cells , Ink4a was enriched with both H3K27me3 and the EZH2 methyltransferase . Deletion of Ezh2 increased the expression of the p16 cell cycle inhibitor encoded by Ink4a', 'These findings are coherent with the finding that Ink4a repression by BMI1 is required for SVZ NSC self-renewal ( Molofsky et al . , 2003 )', 'Given our current understanding of Polycomb-mediated gene repression ( Margueron and Reinberg , 2011 ) , these data suggest that Ink4a repression in SVZ astrocytes requires EZH2 for the local H3K27me3 enrichment , and that BMI1 is required for the subsequent transcriptional repression mediated by PRC1', 'While these data clearly indicated that EZH2 is required for proper SVZ NSC proliferation , the expression of EZH2 in type C and A cells suggested that EZH2 also plays a role in neuronal lineage specification . By deleting Ezh2 in Ink4a/Arf−/− SVZ NSCs , we were able to evaluate the Ink4a/Arf-independent roles of Ezh2 in neurogenesis', 'This genetic strategy enabled the identification of Olig2 as a key direct target of EZH2-mediated repression . OLIG2 is expressed in a subset of both type B1 and type C cells , but not in migratory neuroblasts ( Hack et al . , 2005; Menn et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting that OLIG2 is expressed only at early stages of the SVZ neurogenic lineage', 'However , the epigenetic mechanisms required to repress Olig2 during neurogenesis were not known . Our results demonstrate that EZH2 is critical for Olig2 repression , which we found to be a key aspect of SVZ neurogenesis', 'While EZH2 is well recognized for its role in maintaining stem cells in an undifferentiated state , the EZH2-dependent downregulation of Olig2 illustrates a critical function for EZH2 in cell lineage specification . How EZH2-mediated repression is targeted to specific loci is still not well understood', 'In a subpopulation of SVZ cells , EZH2 was co-expressed with OLIG2 ( Figure 1E ) , suggesting that while EZH2 is present in these cells , its repressive activities have not been localized to the Olig2 locus', 'Future work may reveal how other factors , possibly including long non-coding RNAs ( Simon and Kingston , 2013 ) , serve to dynamically target EZH2 to specific loci at different states of the neurogenic lineage', 'In addition to repressing Olig2 , EZH2 was also required to prevent the aberrant expression of many homeodomain-containing transcription factors ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 , 4 , and 5 ) , including those involved in the embryonic development of non-OB neurons ( Simon et al . , 2001; Ikeda et al . , 2007; Sun et al', ', 2008 ) , suggesting that EZH2 plays a role in restricting SVZ NSCs to neuron subtypes appropriate for the OB . It remains to be determined whether the misexpression of these transcription factors contributes to the neurogenic defect of Ezh2-deleted SVZ NSCs', 'While EZH2 was not observed in mature , non-neurogenic astrocytes , the expression of this H3K27 methyltransferase is common to high-grade gliomas , including glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) ( Crea et al . , 2010; Orzan et al . , 2011 ) . Given that EZH2 directly targeted Ink4a/Arf , a tumor suppressor locus that is frequently inactivated in human GBM ( Brennan et al', ', 2013 ) , it is possible that EZH2 in SVZ astrocytes increases their oncogenic potential . Indeed , mouse SVZ precursors give rise to tumors more frequently than non-SVZ cells when oncogenic alterations are induced ( Alcantara Llaguno et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , EZH2 has been investigated as a potential chemotherapeutic target for gliomas', 'Inhibition of EZH2 in human GBM cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation ( Suva et al . , 2009 ) , and in other GBMs , EZH2 knockdown results in derepression of BMPRIB , which may reduce tumorigenicity ( Lee et al . , 2008 ) . However , recent discoveries raise questions about this therapeutic approach . Expression of H3', '3 with a K27M mutation results in a dominant-negative inhibition of PRC2 function , leading to a global decrease in H3K27me3 , and this K27M H3 . 3 mutation is a major driver of pediatric high-grade glioma ( Bender et al . , 2013; Lewis et al . , 2013 )', 'Our finding that EZH2 can have distinct and separable developmental roles provides a conceptual resolution to these seemingly paradoxical findings . In some gliomas , inhibition of EZH2 may reduce cell proliferation , possibly by de-repressing Ink4a/Arf', 'However , in other gliomas , loss of EZH2 function could lead to the aberrant expression of factors such as OLIG2 , which can drive tumorogenesis ( Ligon et al . , 2007 ) . Intriguingly , OLIG2 is one of most highly expressed genes in the K27M glioma subtype ( Chan et al . , 2013 )', 'Taken together , these findings suggest that the development of EZH2 inhibitors for cancer chemotherapy will benefit from a continued understanding of the multiple , distinct roles that EZH2 plays in development and cell differentiation . While most neurogenesis in the human brain is complete by the time of birth , the infant brain SVZ contains many young migrating neurons ( Sanai et al . , 2011 )', 'In the one-week old human brain , EZH2 expression was primarily observed in DCX+ neuroblasts and a subset of GFAP+ astroglia . Thus , EZH2 is expressed in GFAP+ astroglia in the human SVZ when neurogenesis is observed . In the 18-month-old brain , when SVZ neurogenesis is sparse , we did not find EZH2+ cells in the SVZ', 'In particular , we did not observe GFAP+ , EZH2+ cells at this time point , though we cannot rule out the existence of EZH2+ cells in other parts of the SVZ . Nevertheless , for this region of the lateral ventricle SVZ , the near absence of postnatal neurogenesis correlated with the loss of astroglia expressing EZH2', 'This suggests that this specialized , neurogenic astrocyte population is transient in the human brain . Future studies will be required to determine whether the loss of EZH2 expression is a cause or a consequence of this decrease in SVZ neurogenic activity', 'Taken together , our studies establish EZH2 as a distinguishing feature of astroglial cells in the postnatal neurogenic SVZ of both the mouse and human brain . Furthermore , we identify distinct and separable roles for EZH2 in the production of new neurons from a multipotent stem cell population', 'These results provide novel insights into the complex role that this Polycomb repressive factor plays in normal development and gliomagenesis . \\n Ezh2 F/F mice featuring LoxP sites flanking the four exons that encode for the essential SET domain were maintained and genotyped as previously described ( Su et al . , 2003 ) . hGFAP-Cre ( Zhuo et al', ', 2001 ) and UBC-Cre/ERT2 mice were purchased from from Jackson Laboratories and described previously .

      "Cell-fate reprograming is at the heart of development , yet very little is known about the molecular mechanisms promoting or inhibiting reprograming in intact organisms . In the C . elegans germline , reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation . Here , we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway . This is surprising , since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors . Through a combination of genetics , tissue-specific transcriptome analysis , and functional studies of candidate genes , we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch \t\t , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we identify the Notch signaling pathway as a critical player in this reprograming model . This was unanticipated , since signaling through the Notch receptor GLP-1 ( henceforth GLP-1Notch ) from the somatic gonadal niche is known to maintain germline stem cell/progenitor fate ( Kimble and Crittenden , 2007 ) . To understand this novel , reprograming-promoting role of GLP-1Notch , we combined genetics with tissue-specific expression profiling . We identified genes regulated by GLP-1Notch , including genes recently shown to maintain the germline stem/progenitor cells ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) \t\t Score: 0.8599\n",

Thus , the wild-type levels of GLP-1Notch signaling are either insufficient to induce expression of many potential target genes ( see below ) , or their expression is controlled by additional mechanisms , perhaps similarly to lip-1 mRNA , which , while induced by GLP-1Notch , is post-transcriptionally degraded in the distal-most gonad ( Hajnal and Berset , 2002; Lee et al . , 2006 ) \t\t Score: 0.8417\n",

      "2 stresses the importance of counteracting PRC2 in reprograming . However , only the expression of utx-1 is activated by the GLP-1Notch signaling , suggesting that it is the activity of UTX-1 which is key for the reprograming dependent on GLP-1Notch signaling . The inhibition of GeCo enhancement upon utx-1 RNAi in the rrf-1 background suggested that UTX-1 functions in the germline . To test the potential expression of utx-1 in the germline , we constructed a strain expressing single copy-integrated , FLAG and GFP-tagged , functional UTX-1 ( expressed from the endogenous utx-1 promoter under the control of endogenous utx-1 3'UTR ) . We found that this protein was indeed expressed in the germline ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) \t\t Although we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the reprograming-facilitating role of UTX-1 depends on its expression in another somatic tissue ( such as the intestine , in which RNAi remains functional in the rrf-1 mutant; Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) , the germline expression of UTX-1 reported here suggests a germline-autonomous function . Consistent with this hypothesis , manipulating either PRC2 or GLP-1Notch affected the germline expression of utx-1 . Although additional factors , such as the uncharacterized C07G1 . 6 and the ortholog of the human aldolase A ( Kuwabara and O'Neil , 2001; Shaye and Greenwald , 2011 ) might contribute to reprograming , they appear to be less critical .

      "Considering the antagonistic relation between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 on cell proliferation and gene regulation , we wondered whether GeCo triggered by the depletion of PRC2 would be sensitive to Notch signaling .

      "['Lung-resident ( LR ) mesenchymal stem and stromal cells ( MSCs ) are key elements of the alveolar niche and fundamental regulators of homeostasis and regeneration . We interrogated their function during virus-induced lung injury using the highly prevalent respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) which causes severe outcomes in infants . We applied complementary approaches with primary pediatric LR-MSCs and a state-of-the-art model of human RSV infection in lamb . Remarkably , RSV-infection of pediatric LR-MSCs led to a robust activation , characterized by a strong antiviral and pro-inflammatory phenotype combined with mediators related to T cell function . In line with this , following in vivo infection , RSV invades and activates LR-MSCs , resulting in the expansion of the pulmonary MSC pool . Moreover , the global transcriptional response of LR-MSCs appears to follow RSV disease , switching from an early antiviral signature to repair mechanisms including differentiation , tissue remodeling , and angiogenesis . These findings demonstrate the involvement of LR-MSCs during virus-mediated acute lung injury and may have therapeutic implications . ', 'Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) is endemic in South Sudan , where outbreaks occur frequently . Because of changes in the immune system during pregnancy , pregnant women are considered particularly vulnerable for developing complications of VL disease , including opportunistic infections . There is limited evidence available about clinical aspects and treatment outcomes of VL in pregnancy . We describe characteristics , maternal and pregnancy outcomes from a cohort of pregnant women with VL . We conducted a retrospective analysis using routine programme data from a MSF health facility in Lankien , Jonglei State , South Sudan , between Oct 2014 and April 2018 . Records were extracted of women diagnosed with VL while pregnant , and those symptomatic during pregnancy but diagnosed during the first two weeks postpartum . Records were matched with a random sample of non-pregnant women of reproductive age ( 15–45 years ) with VL from the same period . We included 113 women with VL in pregnancy , and 223 non-pregnant women with VL . Women with VL in pregnancy presented with more severe anaemia , were more likely to need blood transfusion ( OR 9 . 3; 95%CI 2 . 5–34 . 2 ) and were more often prescribed antibiotics ( OR 6 . 0; 95%CI 3 . 4–10 . 6 ) , as compared to non-pregnant women with VL . Adverse pregnancy outcomes , including miscarriage and premature delivery , were reported in 20% ( 16/81 ) where VL was diagnosed in pregnancy , and 50% 13/26 ) where VL was diagnosed postpartum . Postpartum haemorrhage was common . Pregnant women were more likely to require extension of treatment to achieve cure ( OR 10 . 0; 95%CI 4 . 8–20 . 9 ) , as compared to non-pregnant women with VL . Nevertheless , overall initial cure rates were high ( 96 . 5% ) and mortality was low ( 1 . 8% ) in this cohort of pregnant women with VL . This is the largest cohort in the literature of VL in pregnancy . Our data suggest that good maternal survival rates are possible in resource-limited settings , despite the high incidence of complications . ']\n"
